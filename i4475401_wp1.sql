North by Northwest, Cherry Chill, Riverdale, which running route do I take?\r\nLook I\'ll be frank with you College Park may not seem like the best place to run, but in all honesty it\'s actually not half bad. If all you\'ve done for 4 years was jog around campus that\'s your loss. there miles of trails where you can go up hills, run around lakes, and even long run down to D.C. Whatever you choose to do just remember every Thursday, 4-7, is the Riverdale farmers market, hey food detours are always acceptable in my book.\r\n\r\n2. Never underestimate the value of your guest pass\r\nLike me maybe you got your dinning plan and said why would I need 6 guest passes I don\'t know a single upperclassman at Maryland. That my friend is where you\'ve gone wrong, guest passes are an invaluable commodity. Oh you\'ve perfected the left hand swipe you say! The left hand swipe may often be seen as cold and disconnected instead show your favorite upperclassman some love and maybe tomorrows workout won\'t be so hard.\r\n\r\n3.What is Briggs\'s real name?\r\nI\'m going to be honest with you... I don\'t know. If you can figure out the real story behind why he\'s called Briggs please let me know it\'s been 6 weeks and all I\'ve gotten is some story about a Trey sized bear and perpetually being known as a freshman. \r\n\r\n4. Should I race? 8k\'s/6k\'s seem hard and why waste a perfectly good Saturday on running?\r\nShould you? is this even a question of course you should! Okay to be fair we all know that feeling when you show up to a meet with the immense pressure of 2 coaches and an entire team on your shoulders. Well you\'re on the club team now the only pressure should be to win the free candy bars the top 10 runners get. Maybe the heat got to you today and you couldn\'t quite crack the top 10 never fear someone is always down for chipotle where you can celebrate that new Pr with a burrito bowl and the brand new chipotle queso. On another note if your race was in the state of Virginia  that\'s a prize unto itself.\r\n\r\nWell there it is my first ever blog post!

At the most unsuspecting moment, I was caught off guard when the most beautiful woman I have ever seen crossed my path. I felt the need to share this story with all of you because... it happened while I was running.\r\n\r\nIt was August 7, 2016 early in the morning. My day started with an early wake up call so I could drive out to the NCR Trail to do my Sunday long run before work. It was a pretty standard Sunday, I thought. For those unfamiliar with this trail. It is a very flat rail trail that runs straight for dozens of miles, so it\'s always an out and back run. The trail is covered in shade in the morning. A very nice feeling for a hot summer morning. The air felt cool as I was running by lively green trees passing a plethora of fellow runners of all ages and physical abilities. I have seen many attractive runners on this trail before but never gave a second thought about it. Many runners give a friendly wave to a comrade in short shorts. It\'s a great feeling for the first 5 miles or so. The population thins as we go further out but eventually I turn around at the mile 7 marker. I re-enter the heavily populated zone of friendly runners. This time I was a bit more tired. I had just passed mile 11 when ...(pause for dramatic effect)...it happened.\r\n\r\nI look up. Far down the trail I see a female runner with something of a easy looking stride. Something typically seen on the trail. As I was running towards her, and she towards me, I sensed the most amazing feeling tugging at my soul. I couldn\'t help myself from having a smile appear across my face. I felt as if the world was moving in slow motion when I was looking at her. She was absolutely perfect from head to toe. I still wish to this day I would\'ve spoken to her but I could not muster any words as we passed by each other. My breath was taken away, but my memory of her speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nI still remember her perfect casual run with that perfect mid-foot stride in her Brooks running shoes that showed she was quite an experienced runner. Her legs a beautiful tan, looking quite nice with minimal imperfections up to her pink Nike running shorts. Her yellow tank top went so well with those shorts and a white running hat to complete the outfit. It was a look that a woman over the age of 50 should never be able to pull off... but she did it perfectly. Her long grey hair was pulled back into a pony tail that bounced marvelously along with her stride. Her strong jaw and relaxed shoulders while running commanded a soothing look of power that is nearly indescribable. This woman was flawless.\r\n\r\nHer fitness was impeccable even before considering the fact that she had already birthed 2 successful kids (a daughter who\'s 23 and graduated from Cornell, and a son who\'s 20 and studying at UMD). But we won\'t let this take away from how successful she is. I could talk for hours about her and this moment we shared. Alas, time only seemed to be in slow motion as much as I wanted it to stop. Eventually this woman was behind me as we ran by each other, and her back was facing mine. She might not have even noticed me to this day, but I sure noticed her. After this encounter, I wish I would\'ve at least said hello to Debbie Tiburzi.\r\n\r\nWe thank you Frank.', 'The Perfect Woman', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '137-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-03-12 23:46:27', '2017-03-13 03:46:27', '', 137, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/137-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In this edition, we have routes of both short and long length, so there\'s bound to be something for everyone. I will not be including pictures of the routes in this post in order to keep it from reaching a colossal size, but feel free to click on the links to get a better view of the routes.\r\n\r\nLakes/ New Neighborhoods (5.72 miles): This route takes you through a new townhouse / neighborhood type thing off of greenbelt road, around a small lake, then back along lake artemesia. Also, about halfway through this route you can take a left once you get off of the trail and cross greenbelt road to get to Berwyn, if you\'re looking for a longer run. Additionally, there\'s a water fountain on this route, so that\'s a plus. Look for it in the neighborhood. IMPORTANT NOTE: The trail is so new that the most recent satellite pictures from google maps do not show the trail, so if you look on the map and don\'t see it, don\'t worry, it\'s there. http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875411272\r\n\r\nGreenbelt Roadkill (8.84 miles): Despite it\'s name, this run is relatively safe, and there\'s a beautiful lake you can run around. Pretty much a straight shot up greenbelt road, you\'ll reach lakecrest drive around 3.4 miles, and once there, you can run around lake greenbelt, which is about a mile around, and on a nice gravel/ dirt trail. You can also run back through greenbelt park if you want, but that adds extra mileage to your run. http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875413189\r\n\r\nLost (8.53 miles): Brought to you by Ryun, this run starts the exact same way as greenbelt roadkill, but you cross greenbelt road once you get to the greenbelt park entrance. Then, you take a left and follow the road all the way through the park, and down good luck road on to campus drive and back to campus. Beware of hills. Route name courtesy of Dab King himself. http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875414515\r\n\r\nLong neighborhoods (6.55 miles): This route is the OG \"new route\" I came up with last year. It\'s your standard neighborhoods, but with around 2 miles added on around the university hills duck pond. You can also just do the duck pond part and head back to campus if you want to do a short run (~4 miles), or you can add on metro if you want to do a longer run (~9 miles). http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875416639\r\n\r\nPG Plaza (6.98 miles): This route has been around for a while, but it wasn\'t on the website so I figured I would add it to this post. Run along adelphi road as if you were going to do neighborhoods, but don\'t turn on to Well\'s parkway, and instead run towards a tall building you will see on your right. Once at the plaza, CAREFULLY cross east-west highway (preferably at a stoplight) and run until you find a trail on your left, which will lead you to south-northwest, which you can take back to campus. http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875418334\r\n\r\nHammock Park/ Art District (5.39 miles): This run takes you to the new hammock park in the art district off of river road. From the park, you can take many routes back to campus, ranging from simply turning around to hopping on riverdale. Also, with the completion of a bridge over the metro tracks, this route could be a loop which can loop back to south campus, but we\'ll have to wait until the bridge is completed. I have it as an out-and-back on the map. http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875419546\r\n\r\nThat\'s all for now, I\'ve got a few ideas for some more routes, but I\'d like to run them first to see if they are actually viable.

It\'s your standard neighborhoods, but with around 2 miles added on around the university hills duck pond. You can also just do the duck pond part and head back to campus if you want to do a short run (~4 miles), or you can add on metro if you want to do a longer run (~9 miles). http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1875416639\r\n\r\nPG Plaza (6.98 miles): This route has been around for a while, but it wasn\'t on the website so I figured I would add it to this post.

Also, with the completion of a bridge over the metro tracks, this route could be a loop which can loop back to south campus, but we\'ll have to wait until the bridge is completed.

This past year starting December 29th 2016 I decided I would run at least 1.61 kilometers or 1 mile a day for a year. I’m proud to say after 365 days of putting one foot in front of the other I’ve done it. So what does 1 year of running in Rylan’s shoes look like? My physical/spiritual journey took me to 7 states, 6 countries, saw me cover roughly 2,500 miles, destroy 4 pairs of running shoes, drink 18 gallons of chocolate milk, and burn roughly 215,000 calories (for the record that’s 860 packages of peanut M&amp;M’s). I ran through colonial capitals, up volcanos, past giant soybean statues, and even took a stab at the now infamous historic Berwyn running tour. Looking back I’ve found these experiences, extraordinary for a reason, that surprised even myself. Every day I have been fortunate enough to wake up thinking today I’m going to go for a run. Regardless of the weather, location, people, or life situation I could be certain that I would lace up my running shoes and go out for a run. This unwavering commitment to something so small and meaningless might confuse a lot of people, but to me it opened my eyes to the wonders of dedication and passion. Such passion has led me to meet other running obsessed individuals who, even though they put my hat on the flagpole and made fun of my aqua jogging, I would consider some of my most best friends. So where does this leave you, UMD Club Running blog readers. Maybe you’re already an avid runner or perhaps I made you read this and you absolutely detest bipedal movement.

If need be, I can supply photographs of this event that will positively identify myself attending the formal as well as a timestamp that places the formal in the spring season of the year 2013.\r\n\r\nTo read this administration so confidently assert that they are, in fact, the first to schedule a Spring Formal has, to say the least, disgusted me. I expect more from a club that prides itself in respecting its history and those that came before them.\r\n\r\nIf this error is not corrected, I will be forced to take more aggressive action against this administration.

(267, 27, '2018-08-23 14:10:10', '2018-08-23 18:10:10', '<h4>By Dylan Hernandez</h4>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Preface</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays (I had class Sat/Sun much of Spring semester), so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laughed and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additionally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, Andrew, and the GRC folks who came out for all showing their grit in running this race as well<sup>3</sup>.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>4</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>5</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4:58 sounded like a pretty good start to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan.

I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> There were many GRC runners who came out to race, but, unfortunately, I only had chances to talk with Zachary Gallin and Aneesh Rahangdale about their races that day and on subsequent trots through Foxhall - 1:12 and 1:11, respectively, if I recall correctly - some speedy lads\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laughed and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additionally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, Andrew, and the GRC folks who came out for all showing their grit in running this race as well<sup>3</sup>.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>4</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>5</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4:58 sounded like a pretty good start to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> There were many GRC runners who came out to race, but, unfortunately, I only had chances to talk with Zachary Gallin and Aneesh Rahangdale about their races that day and on subsequent trots through Foxhall - 1:12 and 1:11, respectively, if I recall correctly - some speedy lads\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

Disclaimer: There aren\'t THAT many historic spots on this run.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289721822\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289721822</a>\r\n\r\nCemetery Loop / Hills for days (9.9 / 6.2 miles): This one just sounds like torture, and to some degree it is, but it is also home to some of the best places to run (in my opinion). There is a shortcut to get to this route behind courtyards, which I have shown on the map. This route can be an out and back, and it\'s 6.2 miles if you turn around right at the cemetery. If you decide to run through the cemetery, you can reach the northwest branch trail, and take that back to campus. There are lots of hills, so don\'t blame me if this route kills you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289727930\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289727930</a>\r\n\r\nGreenbelt Lake Loop (9.5 miles): Take a trip down memory lane back to the time trial at the beginning of the season and run to Greenbelt Lake! This route is pretty nice for a long run, and incorporates some trail running which is always nice. The map is pretty easy to follow.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289731311\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289731311</a>\r\n\r\nSligo Creek (10+ miles): I\'m 90% sure I\'m the only one who has done this run, but I 100% recommend it for a long run. Take University Blvd to the power lines, and then take those to the Sligo Creek trail. From here, head north for however long your heart desires. It\'s about 3 miles to the trail, but once you get there it\'s beautiful.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289733390\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289733390</a>\r\n\r\nStupid Neighborhoods (6.35 miles): This route was completely improvised because PG Plaza couldn\'t be done, and it ended up being a big mash up of routes, but I kinda liked it so I decided to add it to this post. Look at the map before you run this one, or I guarantee you will get lost!!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289735244\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289735244</a>\r\n\r\nThat\'s all for this post, let me know if you guys have any routes / distances you want me to add to the next one!

(252, 27, '2018-05-15 12:47:48', '2018-05-15 16:47:48', '<h4>By Dylan Hernandez</h4>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Preface</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays (I had class Sat/Sun much of Spring semester), so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laughed and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additionally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, Andrew, and the GRC folks who came out for all showing their grit in running this race as well<sup>3</sup>.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>4</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>5</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4:58 sounded like a pretty good start to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt.

I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> There were many GRC runners who came out to race, but, unfortunately, I only had chances to talk with Zachary Gallin and Aneesh Rahangdale about their races that day and on subsequent trots through Foxhall - 1:12 and 1:11, respectively, if I recall correctly - some speedy lads\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></p>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></p>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment).[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></p>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></p>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></p>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I just knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time is 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running.

Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unenjoyable. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n\r\n<strong>AYF</strong>\r\n\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season -- my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown was more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in two days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue with my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted</li>\r\n 	<li>Wayne’s World reference</li>\r\n 	<li>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running.

Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan.

Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown was more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in two days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue with my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running.

Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan.

Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue with my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additonally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, and Andrew for all showing their grit in running this race as well.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue with my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additonally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, and Andrew for all showing their grit in running this race as well.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue with my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

(257, 27, '2018-05-15 12:45:43', '2018-05-15 16:45:43', '<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Preface</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additonally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, and Andrew for all showing their grit in running this race as well.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue with my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was\r\n\r\nadopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additonally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, and Andrew for all showing their grit in running this race as well.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan.

I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\n\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\n\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\n\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\n\n<hr />\n\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\n\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\n\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\n\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\n\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\n\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\n\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\n\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\n\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays (I had class Sat/Sun much of Spring semester), so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\n\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\n</ul>\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\n</ul>\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\n\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\n\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\n\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laughed and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\n\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\n\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\n2 mile - 10:42\n5k - 16:42 ish\n5 mile - 26:57\n10k - 33:29\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\n\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\n\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\n\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running.

Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\n\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\n\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\n\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\n\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\n\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>4</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\n\n<hr />\n\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>5</sup>.\n\n<hr />\n\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\n\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\n\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4:58 sounded like a pretty good start to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\n\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\n\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan.

Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\n\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\n\nI feel ready for more.\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\n\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\n\n<sup>3</sup> There were many GRC runners who came out to race, but, unfortunately, I only had chances to talk with Zachary Gallin and Aneesh Rahangdale about their races that day and on subsequent trots through Foxhall - 1:12 and 1:11, respectively, if I recall correctly - some speedy lads\n\n<sup>4 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laugh and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running.

Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4;58 sounded like a pretty good star to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself. Each black triangle in the upper right corner of a cell is a note (times, distance, brief comment)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe training plan I followed was an adaptation of my spring 2016 UMD Club Running 5k training plan adjusted for my own goals and abilities. Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laughed and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additionally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, Andrew, and the GRC folks who came out for all showing their grit in running this race as well<sup>3</sup>.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>4</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>5</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4:58 sounded like a pretty good start to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan.

Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> There were many GRC runners who came out to race, but, unfortunately, I only had chances to talk with Zachary Gallin and Aneesh Rahangdale about their races that day and on subsequent trots through Foxhall - 1:12 and 1:11 if I recall correctly, respectively - some speedy lads\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

It has ended, thankfully, by choice and not by any other externality I am habituated to, namely injury. My dual Achilles rupture* in April 2015 (Spring, junior year) at the end of the Lumberjack workout not only shaped my running years to come, but was also serendipitously documented by Dan Russo’s GoPro operated by Abby on a bike, and can be found within the depths of YouTube given enough sifting. There is no one moment where I could tell my Achilles were going down the can, but as I <em>tried</em> to cooldown, it was unmistakable. The following seasons, years were wrought with running injuries of various identities and anatomical locations stemming from those ruptures. I can only blame myself, as I still tried to run Hopkins-Loyola, Widener, and the Cherry Blossom 10 Miler in the following weeks after the injury because I refused to believe I was finally injured after 6 years of avoiding it, and while in the shape of my life, to boot. I have re-ruptured each Achilles one other time since, both times in early 2017.\r\n\r\n<em>*Although Achilles ruptures are usually thought of as complete tears, mine were a collection of simultaneously occurring minor tears in the main tendons combined with larger tears in the sheaths of the tendons, causing the interstitial tendon fluid to leak and cause major swelling.</em>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Dues Ex Machina</strong></h5>\r\nFast forward through the on-off cyclical hell that was recurring injury and we arrive somewhere along the Madison County Transit Nature Trail in Edwardsville, Illinois the day after Christmas, 2017 (record scratch, freeze frame – “yup, that’s me”). It’s 20 something degrees and a light flurry is dusting the Great Plains a soft white this quiet, still winter afternoon. I am home for winter break at my parent’s home on a low-effort morning-after-christmas-dinner burnoff run, hobbling along because my left Achilles had not loosened up since NIRCA nats, where it became not just stiff, but painful and inflamed due to the race. I had struggled with my Achilles all season, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I wanted to help out the GRC team as much as I could while I was there. The inflammation waded over time, but the stiffness was something I was slowly trying to work through via combination of days off and days on jogging 2-3 miles as well as biking. As I ran along, there came a slight hill in the path. I usually tried to keep my heel on the ground for uphills to avoid stressing my Achilles, but, for some reason, I decided to go up on my toes this time around. Halfway up the hill, my left Achilles gave out. It felt as if it were a strand of cooked spaghetti that was pulled apart via tensile force, snapping in half. I stopped immediately. I hopped off that foot and was terrified of putting it back down. “<em>That’s it. I’m a goner</em>,” I thought, while saying completely different words out loud, “<em>my running career is over</em>” … but I then noticed there was no pain. I realized, while it felt like it snapped, there was somehow, just <em>somehow</em>, no pain. I put my foot down gingerly, stood, walked, and then started to run again. Faster. And Faster. The pain and stiffness had gone and stiff scar tissue had likely torn, thus marking the rebirth of my Achilles and my running career, albeit with cautious optimism. I was confused what caused this, but knew for sure it felt like I had new feet. A week passed of running with no pain or stiffness and I made the decision: it was time to begin The Process.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Hoya Saxa and Other Arbitrary Mantras</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Roger Bannister usually could only train during his 30 minute lunch break, so why can’t I? I won’t go sub four, but maybe sub something...”</em>\r\n\r\n– Me, to myself, looking at my Spring class schedule in January.\r\n\r\nI had goals. I was healthy. I was motivated. To reach those goals, training could not be an afterthought. If there was no time to run, I made time. I didn’t know how long I would be healthy, so I made it a priority to make the most out of it, to make my athletics an ironic principle component of my final semester in academia. I had never been particularly fast, but this was my chance to try to be through all the barriers from years past that had once prevented me from doing so. What rocks those were. Hoya Saxa<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI once remarked on my Running2Win log that classes were something I snuck in between runs and not the contrary. Regardless of that dismissive-of-academics comment, I was still a full on tryhard with school. I had achieved a lifetime high GPA the previous semester and was determined to build on it. This meant long hours studying and working on projects where, despite being paired with other Georgetown graduate level students, I was still the only one who could be bothered to do any of the work (and I, sadly and very literally, mean <em>any</em>). This added up and detracted from sleep time, if anything else. I skipped a handsome handful of after class happy hours to speed walk home, change, and get out the door as soon as possible so I could get back home, shower, eat, and study. Running was a priority, but academics also had to be a priority, much to my chagrin.\r\n\r\n“<em>Oh, sorry, I’m going to go run, first</em>” became a common response. So common, in fact, that my classmates began referring to my only answer for leaving group study sessions of running then eating as “<em>Dylan Things</em>.” The many students from India were particularly perplexed by it, as I gleaned that recreational exercise, much less distance running, was not popular back home.\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>We’re getting lunch before our six hour lab, want to come with?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Nope, sorry, going to squeeze in a run. Thanks, though.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em> “</em>Oh, I see… classic Dylan Things, then?<em>”</em>\r\n\r\n“<em>Yup, classic.</em>”\r\n\r\n<em>“</em>Alright, see you in lab at noon, then.<em>”</em>\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. 10:15AM. I planned the sequence as I headed towards the door to the lecture hall: 15 minutes to walk home, change, quick stretch, and get out the door. A hair and a half under 60 minutes for my 10.2 mile medium steady route. 15 minutes to shower and not forget my lab coat. 3 minutes to make the PB&amp;J I’ll eat on the walk to lab. 8 minute walk to my building. 2 minutes to get to the lab, put up my backpack, and throw on my lab coat. At the bench 1 minute before noon. Roger Bannister usually could only train during his lunch break, so why can’t I?\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Crossing the T’s and Dotting the Lower Case J’s</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"752\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2JmaAwX.png\" width=\"752\" height=\"342\" /> Spring 2018 training plan as written for myself.

Since I knew I would have to give this my all if I wanted decent results, I spent significant amounts of time tinkering this plan, such as adding one rep here and adding 15s there to the rep rests and taking 5x1000m and changing it to hills and a 1k cut down. As the season progressed, I modified the plan based on how I felt and what I thought I was increasingly (or sometimes, decreasingly) capable of. This lead to a hyper-specific training schedule with the t’s crossed and the lower case j’s dotted on every line<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are likely some familiar blocks – such as medium steadies on Wednesdays and Tuesday/Friday workouts – and some new elements such as a more refined taper (4/15 onward). This being a personal plan meant that I could track my actual weekly mileage on the side as well as average my weekly mileage before tapering, giving myself an easy at-a-glance analysis of my season as I progressed. The overarching technical goal of this training plan was simple: <em>stay relaxed</em>. I am proud to say I stuck to this goal for the majority of the season with exception of the latter half of April due to outside stressors. From a developmental standpoint, I believe staying relaxed on runs and workouts was the primary underlining achievement of this season. GRC had workouts Monday/Thursday with long runs on Saturday and my class and internship schedule was just such that I could only make some Fridays, so I decided to stick to my own training plan yet compete with the club. Regardless, dropping in on practices here and there with them was always a highlight and I am grateful for those times, especially after being able to consistently train with them last semester.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Up and Ups</strong></h5>\r\nThere were several key workouts that served as significant, not only due to the quality of the run, but because of the confidence they gave me.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>1/26</strong> – 5 mile tempo that served as my unofficial new 8k PR (from 26:54 at NIRCA regionals at Princeton, Fall 2015 to 26:44 en route on the Mt. Vernon trail). From my R2W log: “<em>26:53 for 5 miles, 26:44 ish at 8k. 5:29, :28, :26, :18, :16. I don’t know, man, I just felt good.” </em>Nothing serves up some fresh confidence like negative splitting like that after only 3 weeks of training.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/14</strong> – 10.08 mile medium steady in 57:18 (5:41/mi). From R2W: “<em>don’t get me wrong, I fucked up this med-stead. Maybe it’s no workouts for the past 6 days, but I hit 5:35 uphill with a 5:5x effort.” </em>The day after a 17.7 mile double I drop the hottest “medium steady” of 2018. Beat my 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler time by a minute and a half on this run which I took excessively hard for way too little reason aside from feeling good.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>2/20</strong> – 14.3mi OTD easy/hill repeat double. This showed me how much effort in a day my legs could take and still go on to feel comfortable in a medium steady the next day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/4</strong> – 16.1mi weekly long run in 1:37:02 (5:57/mi). From R2W: “<em>Lots on the mind today</em>. <em>Just let the legs do what they wanted.” </em>And what they wanted was to split 1:17:30 for the last half marathon portion of the run, finishing with four mid/low 5:4x\'s. No long run has ever felt that good. I felt like butter sliding across the hot pan that was the C&amp;O Canal Towpath. Most other long runs averaged 6:10/mi or slightly faster for the month of Feb, but not sub 6:05 until that day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/6</strong> – 10x2/2 farlek on treadmill with 1.0 incline. “on” sections @ 5min pace. The incline is what got me here and it was a struggle at Yates Fieldhouse with this one, but the tired yet satisfied feeling I ended the workout with told me it was good work.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>3/30</strong> – The Lumberjack. It was hard work. No Achilles ruptures to be found, just a good old fashioned hard effort with a 62 second last 400.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>4/16</strong> – 11x320m relays with GRC. Hit 47s/48s 300m splits en route to each 320m rep. After some disappointing workouts due to lack of sleep, it felt good to stride out again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The Down but Not Outs</strong></h5>\r\nIf one were to make a graph over time of the maintenance of my quality of life outside of training during the season, it would look like the silhouetted profile of a rusted serrated knife. I was only in a one year program, though, and this was just one season, so although I am complaining thoroughly in this post, I usually just had a grin-and-bear-it attitude as the season actually progressed. My advice to anyone reading this fine bit of 2AM intro and retrospection is to not do that. Take rest days both mental and physical if you feel as though you need it and remember to drink water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I ensured to make note of the nadirs in addition to the zeniths as they came along, both minor and major:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/14</strong>: Some R&amp;R at a cabin in Virginia meant sleeping in past the time I would run before a hike, reducing mileage for the week. Who am I kidding, though, I wasn\'t going to run before that hike anyway.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 1/28</strong>: No Thursday run. From my R2W log: “<em>no run yesterday. woke up and achilles was slightly stiff and didn\'t care to mess with that despite my training grind lately.” </em>While I considered my Achilles healed to some extent, there still occurred ephemeral moments of vulnerability that encouraged caution. Typically, my solution to these moments was to just…. Stop. And stop I did, even if just for a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPer my former boss\' 102 year old grandmother, when asked how she manage to live so long: <em>\"When I felt good, I did whatever the hell I wanted. When I felt bad, I didn\'t do a damn thing.\" </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/4:</strong> Registration for Happy Valley Invitational 3k unfortunately botched by race coordinator, an equal parts frustrating but thankful event as my Achilles was again showing timid yet noticeable signs of restlessness. From R2W: “<em>Registration botched for Happy Valley. Couldn\'t run. Took today as an achilles health day as it has become a bit sore in the mornings.” </em>I think, season wise, this was a fortunate coincidence.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Week of 2/18:</strong> Visited my girlfriend at the time in Philadelphia on Saturday. To do that, I had to drive 4 hours through traffic to Philly after doing my 10% weekly mileage med-stead Friday workout. Going immediately from a workout to sitting for so long was not a good look for my Achilles. It would have been my only Sunday-Saturday 80 mile week of the season (there were three 80+ mile 7-day totals, though), but the rest of the week was of exceptional quality, especially that Tuesday where I doubled with an easy run/1min hill repeat workout that set me at 14.3mi OTD. That day, workout was a mental bolster for me, as I started to understand just how much effort my legs can take in a day.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Weeks of 3/4/18 and 3/11:</strong> 4 state challenge. Didn’t regret doing it with Charlie and Ramiz. Did regret doing it mid-season. Apart from voluntarily disrupting my sleep schedule, it left the bottoms of my feet on/off sore for the remainder of the season. Some runs I would even say they were painful, likely due to hiking in six year old worn out hiking boots. From R2W: <em>“extreme lack of sleep due to 4 state/school and internships projects affected recent runs. took off to catch up on sleep” </em>Go to class between runs all wanted, but I couldn’t ignore class, lack of sleep, or a recent break up which all contributed to record stress levels affecting my training. Motivational running posters may tell you otherwise, but sometimes it’s near impossible completely separate the stressors of real life from the freedom of running. Regardless, adhering to The Process was a key factor in maintaining a level head during that time, no matter how much The Process itself was affected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, there was my asthma. My asthma strays from reacting to the likes of peanuts in favor of twitterpation with mile repeats and similar workouts. I was unable to do even one of three miler workout attempts without my asthma being a dominant or terminal factor in the quality of the workout. Of the 27 workouts I attempted this season (not including long runs and med-steads), I completed 21 entirely on the first try, where 23 were completed including next-day restarts. Of the 4 I did not complete, asthma was the terminating factor in 2 of them. Lack of sleep affected the quality of 4 workouts and was cause for not finishing 1 workout included in that 4. Both lack of sleep and asthma combined affected the quality of 6 out of 23 completed workouts. So, over a fourth of the workouts for this season were adversely affected by factors unrelated to my training itself. All workouts affected by lack of sleep were in April, the month where most of my exams and all of my projects and presentations were due. Not good, man, but it’s still the best season I’ve ever put forth with that considered.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One (and Two) and Done</strong></h5>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"352\"]<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bRoMde3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"640\" /> Quasi-chronological bib wall in my room with UMD graduation tassel in top right. Early on in my running career I threw out my bibs like some chump, so there are many high school bibs missing.[/caption]\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The One: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run</strong></h6>\r\nThis was the primary focus of my season. My long con was to run a fast enough time to submit for elite entry into the San Francisco marathon, which I planned to use to qualify for Boston 2019. Elite entry meant free entry. Avoiding paying $280 to run a Boston qualifier? Yeah, I could go for that. After emailing the SF marathon organizers they told me they would consider a 10 mile time equivalent if it were fast enough, though they did not tell me just how fast it had to be. My mental bet was sub 55 or 54 given the 2:40 marathon elite standard on their website, but I did not know for sure. I had not put forth a race effort since November, so I figured I could go barely sub 54, though, on paper, I could probably hit low 53. I have always struggled to translate my training into races, so I knew I all I could do was leave it all on the cherry pink tinted streets of DC and hope for the mercy of the race organizers.\r\n\r\nMost asthma and sleep deprivation related season complications had yet to hit by the time Charlie, Cerruzi, and I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">took an Uber</span> drove downtown peering through frosted windshield to the race staging grounds, so I was fresh and ready to race. The 30 degree temps with 15mph winds were put to the back of my mind as I headed to the front of the Yellow corral, jogging in place as I watched the elites (Centro, Derrick, Jablonski, Puskedra, to name a few) stride out just ahead of me. I took a deep breath as the horn went off and I was effortlessly floating along with the chase pack in about the same breath. I was already behind my goal pace of 5:20 after I slipped by the first mile in 5:26. I tried to make a small adjustment for this and hit mile 2 in 5:15, then mile 3 in 5:10. I don’t think that hurt me in terms of the whole race too much, but it was absolutely much faster than I wanted. Adjustments after that had me floating around the low 5:20s for the next 5k or so, and the next 5 miles were sprinkled with a couple 5:1x’s. A nice surge in motivation also came at mile 5 (26:57) when a wild Patrick Hanley suddenly appeared to cheer me on: “Yes, Dylan! Let’s go! Go get him! Come on!” Thanks, Pat.\r\n\r\nI focused on sticking with a small pack of 5-6 I was with nearly the entire race before we strung out the last two miles, including someone with a blue and yellow singlet and someone with a GRC singlet and a white cap whom I was neck and neck with since mile 3. The last two miles were pretty dang windy and I had nobody around me to hide behind (a good and a bad thing as I was in the general front of the race). I think I could have cut 5 seconds off mile 10 if I realized I was slouching over and losing form sooner rather than just near the end, but that’s likely my biggest gripe about the race, which is good. 1200m from the finish I surged to gain a definitive lead on the white cap guy I’d been with all race, losing audio track of his breathing behind me for the first time in the race. 800m out I could only see two far out in front of me and a third about 20m ahead of me – the guy in the blue and yellow. I glued my eyes to his back, trying to accelerate to catch him, when about 400m from the finish he simply stopped in his tracks and puked. I couldn’t make out what it was he ate the night before, but an educated guess was pasta. Poor dude. The two who were chasing me were left in the dust over the last half mile due to what I could only imagine was my track speed, and, upon seeing 53:50 on the timer as I rounded the curve, I sprinted with all I had left on home.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"299\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zz5qBbq.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"451\" /> Pictured: gun time, the aerobic and beard peak of my season[/caption]\r\n\r\nI quickly decelerated and put my hands to my knees after crossing the finish line somewhat dramatically with a bit of a yell. I panted for a moment then began to walk forward with my head down, exhausted. I see three pairs of feet ahead of me, so I stick out my hand without looking up much and said, “good race.” I received a firm handshake in return and I looked up as Matt Centrowitz told me, “You too, man.” I was too tired to react to that, so I shook Luke Puskedra and Chris Kwiatkowski’s (Centro’s training partner) hands and joked to Centro that I would knock him on PUBG someday. He laughed and said, “We’ll see about that” as I walked away aimlessly, still catching my breath. I’d later learn I finished right with Michael Wardian, the many time national 50 km champion, otherwise known as the white cap GRC guy I ran with all race. He actually gave a talk at the packet pickup expo the day before, so clearly someone must agree he’s a big deal (no sarcasm). I beat him by almost 10 seconds in the finish cam video; however, the results say his gun <strong>and</strong> net time were 1 second faster than me. Not sure how that makes sense, but I’m still blown away to know that me, some grad student running between exams, was able to race alongside such an accomplished runner at any distance. I’m happy with how I performed that day and I’m especially happy to say that the San Francisco Marathon race organizers accepted my time of 53:55 as elite entry worthy, punching my free ticket to a chance at a Boston qualifying performance in late July.\r\n\r\n<strong>Splits: </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 mile: 5:26\r\n2 mile - 10:42\r\n5k - 16:42 ish\r\n5 mile - 26:57\r\n10k - 33:29\r\n9 mile - 48:31</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Finish – 53:55</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall pace: 5:23/mi</strong>\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Pat for running to the race from CP and being there to cheer me on at miles 5 and 9.8 ish, and Luanne, Dolf, and Danny for all making the trek out to support all of us running. Additonally, a big shout out to Chris, Erin, Esther, Eric, Charlie, and Andrew for all showing their grit in running this race as well.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>And Two: Kehoe Twilight Invitational 5k</strong></h5>\r\n<em>“Adding enough 5-fluorouracil master mix solution to obtain a 500</em><em>µM concentration in the wells of the bottom row of a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with fibrosarcoma spheroids has what effect on the spheroid’s cytotoxic activity? Additionally, calculate how much 5-fluorouracil is needed to obtain this concentration in the wells.” </em>\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I remember thinking to myself during this question on my first final of finals week: 3D Cell Culture and Drug Discovery.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock at the front of the room – it was 3:45pm. I was halfway through an exam I was taking for a class I registered for long ago, <strong><em>before</em></strong> I decided I didn’t want to be a lab scientist after all which was <strong><em>after</em></strong> the add/drop period had already passed. That day, particularly, my lack of enthusiasm for the class was not helped by the fact I had to start warming up for my race at the Kehoe Twilight Invitational in a bit over four hours. By question 27 I was more concerned about not forgetting to pack my spikes than I was about concentrations of a metalloprotease inhibitor. Alas, I cleared my thoughts, admitted to myself I did, in fact, know how to answer the question, and re-focused on the task at hand:\r\n\r\n“<em>It takes 1</em><em>µL 5-fluorouracil to reach a well concentration of 500µM which all but completely halts cytotoxic activity of fibrosarcoma spheroids.”</em>\r\n\r\nAnother 13 questions about a tediously complex yet admittedly interesting subject and I yote out the classroom without even double checking if my bubbles on the Scan Tron sheet were neat and tidy<sup>3</sup>. It was time to grab a quick bite then hop in my car to drive to College Park.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nA storm was brewing in the distance and half of me desperately wanted it to hold off until after the race whereas the other half would not have minded too much if it canceled the race. The weeks following Cherry Blossom and leading up to Kehoe served as the antithesis to my nearly flawless taper (in my opinion, of course) for Cherry blossom, as my legs always seemed to be heavy and my feet always seemed to be sore. I believe the foot soreness I adopted from the 4 state challenge was exacerbated by the race. The intermittent pain was not enough to halt running, but it was enough to make it unpleasant from time to time. I tried to do 16x400m the Tuesday following Cherry Blossom, a rookie mistake. I felt great the day after the race and did a normal 7.5 mile easy run at 6:25/mi because I hardly felt sore from the race, so I decided to continue with a workout on Tuesday. After 4x400m and a 200 in 27 seconds for prosperity, I called the workout and opted to restart the next day.  The next day, Wednesday, I finished 14x400m, but was not happy with it. I felt physically incapable of going faster than 66 or 67 seconds per rep, with my final rep being a fairly strained 64. My legs did not cooperate ever since, and my running of the Crystal City “5k” a week and a half later was marred by heavy legs and a heavier asthma hit, so much so that I opted to leave the ordeal out of my definition of “races” I ran this season<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI felt eerily alright during the mid-downpour warmup around the mall. We had a good crew for this race and in our deliberations on pacing, it was evident a chunk of us would be pacing off each other. First mile expectations ranged from 4:50 to 5 flat, but we all planned to not get too excited off the gun.\r\n\r\nI finished my strides as I noticed some Pacers/Georgetown Running Company lads reading the “GRC” on my chest, possibly wondering if I was just a teammate they hadn’t met yet. My spikes felt firm on my feet and I felt ready to go. After a two command start and the gun, we were off.\r\n\r\nThe pack cruised through some thicc puddles to a 73 second first lap and almost immediately I could tell the pack was beginning to string out slightly. Second lap in 74 and it was me with a group of UMD Club Running chaps and a squad of GRC runners just ahead of us. We worked together through the first mile as a unit: 4:58. I remember telling everyone my goal was 4:50-4:55, but, knowing how I had felt for the past month, 4:58 sounded like a pretty good start to me. I felt labored but relaxed. My breathing was deep and I knew I had to accelerate to keep pace. I surged at about 1800m to catch the group of 3 GRC runners, passing two of them. From then until the 4800, my position was held, passing the 3200m en route in 10:04. I knew a GRC guy was right behind me the whole race, but I knew that I would lose to him in the final lap as my legs were refusing to accelerate any further. I was feeling what I had felt for the past month. My legs and going any faster were like kids kicking and screaming because they didn’t want to go to soccer practice. I was fading despite keeping a tempo. My goal went from 15:30 to just sub 16 real fast as I bent my head down to surge with 300m to go. I felt as if I went no faster than I had the previous three laps, and my kick down the final 100m must have looked like I thought it was lap 5 and not 12.5, but crossing that line was a gargantuan relief nonetheless; a refuge from the exhaustion, the pains, and the toil of a hard-fought season.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me to see Danny finish as I caught my breath, and I glanced to the scoreboard to see “Dylan Hernandez- 15:55.13” just as it came up. I put my arms up in both relief and happiness, but only for what I did that day. In terms of the season, I did not do what I was capable of. In terms of May 4<sup>th</sup> at 9:05pm, though, I did my best, and that is the best I could ask for. It may not be by much, but I am a member of the 15 club now and it feels good to be there after years of being shackled to the 16s by injury.\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>AYF</strong></h5>\r\nAs of Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup>, at 9:20:55.13 PM, my 2018 track season has come to an end. It has ended, thankfully, by choice. Not only by a choice to race no further and rest, but also by a choice to not regret anything about it. I knew this was my last collegiate season, my unexpected second and final shot to represent a university. I knew there were thus risks to take with training, such as making it so ambitious that remaining uninjured would be a stroll along a knife’s edge and that it would be a possible detriment to the very thing I was so thankful to represent. These risks, however, were risks worth taking. Training as if it were for a half marathon for 4 months and then as if it were for a 1500 for 1 month was the about-face I chose to perform in order to run both a 10 miler and 5k I was proud of, nodding to Lydiard along the way. I didn’t run the 5k I thought I was ultimately capable of, but I still met my goals. I met the goals I thought so carefully to set realistically. I met my goals I would have scoffed at myself reaching at any one point in the past four years.\r\n\r\nThe Process paid off. All it asked for was trust and that was all I had to give.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"784\"]<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7znj3mn.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"122\" /> Goals sheet on tab 2 of my training plan. If there were an opportunity to run a 1500 (PR 4:20, Widener 2015 on injured Achilles) or a mile I would have taken it as it\'s a race I never run, but that will have to wait for another season[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe national mall, the C&amp;O Canal Towpath, the Capital Crescent trail, the Mt. Vernon Trail, the Custis trail, Rock Creek Park, Ohio Drive, Arlington National Cemetary, Foxhall, Glover Park, MacArthur Blvd, and so many more to choose from every single day for my routes. I have never before lived in such an aerobic haven. I am incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to explore Georgetown, NOVA, and D.C. via running and I realize my classmates did not have the same vantage point of our area that I had because of it. I feel as if running made my experience here at Georgetown more visceral and I’m glad I was healthy enough to do it. Up next is Livermore, CA for the summer, and it’s got some big route-shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nI always wrote “AYF” – as you feel -- on areas of my training plans where I wanted the athlete to do whatever they were comfortable with that day instead of subscribing to, say, an easy day or medium steady. It conveyed that, sometimes, it is important to follow your gut in the process of moving forward. I receive my M.S. in Biotechnology in three days and after that, I am truly an unattached runner. After that, it will be time to continue my running career as I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel ready for more.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Hoya Saxa<strong>: </strong>“οἵα saxa,” translated from Greek as “what rocks,” referring to the stone wall surrounding Georgetown’s campus and the stalwart defense of its athletics teams at the time the phrase was adopted\r\n\r\n<sup>2 </sup>Wayne’s World reference\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>I got a 72% on this final.

As always, I highly recommend looking at the maps of the routes and/or bringing your phone so that you don\'t get lost!\r\n\r\nCherry Chill Loop (4.9 miles): Fun fact: Cherry Chill can be looped by running through Hollywood! Once you get past the second bridge on cherry chill, take a right and cross Route 1 and head up Hollywood road. Once you reach Rhode Island Ave, take a right and head towards Greenbelt road and back to campus.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289717640\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289717640</a>\r\n\r\nGreenbelt Metro (7.1 miles): This route starts the same as the cherry chill loop, except you go through Hollywood to the Greenbelt Metro station, and back through the new neighborhoods. Just be cautious when running through the metro station, as you will literally be running right by the turnstiles people use to get to the platform. Wouldn\'t recommend this one with a large group of people.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289720103\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289720103</a>\r\n\r\nSemi-Historic Berwyn (4.75 miles): Have you ever wanted to run around all the historic sites in Berwyn? Me neither! But here\'s a route in case you had the sudden urge to do so. There are a couple gates on this run, but they have pedestrian entrances on the sides of them, so be on the look out for those. Disclaimer: There aren\'t THAT many historic spots on this run.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289721822\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289721822</a>\r\n\r\nCemetery Loop / Hills for days (9.9 / 6.2 miles): This one just sounds like torture, and to some degree it is, but it is also home to some of the best places to run (in my opinion). There is a shortcut to get to this route behind courtyards, which I have shown on the map. This route can be an out and back, and it\'s 6.2 miles if you turn around right at the cemetery. If you decide to run through the cemetery, you can reach the northwest branch trail, and take that back to campus. There are lots of hills, so don\'t blame me if this route kills you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289727930\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289727930</a>\r\n\r\nGreenbelt Lake Loop (9.5 miles): Take a trip down memory lane back to the time trial at the beginning of the season and run to Greenbelt Lake! This route is pretty nice for a long run, and incorporates some trail running which is always nice. The map is pretty easy to follow.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289731311\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289731311</a>\r\n\r\nSligo Creek (10+ miles): I\'m 90% sure I\'m the only one who has done this run, but I 100% recommend it for a long run. Take University Blvd to the power lines, and then take those to the Sligo Creek trail. From here, head north for however long your heart desires. It\'s about 3 miles to the trail, but once you get there it\'s beautiful.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289733390\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289733390</a>\r\n\r\nStupid Neighborhoods (6.35 miles): This route was completely improvised because PG Plaza couldn\'t be done, and it ended up being a big mash up of routes, but I kinda liked it so I decided to add it to this post. Look at the map before you run this one, or I guarantee you will get lost!!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289735244\">https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2289735244</a>\r\n\r\nThat\'s all for this post, let me know if you guys have any routes / distances you want me to add to the next one!

The location was Thousand Oaks, California. I entered a running store with my aunt and mother called Roadrunner Sports. My aunt lives in California and she decided to celebrate my first time visiting her out there with a trip to this store. She told me that she would buy me a pair of shoes and a clothing item of my choice. First, I scoured the shoe display searching for something with decent support and cushioning for longer mileage. Eventually, I settled on the Brooks Levitates. (I used these shoes through out indoor and outdoor track that year. They were ok, but I hear the Brooks Levitate 2s aren’t the same.) Next, I began to rummage through the clothing isles waiting for something to catch my eye. I thought perhaps a new pair of split shorts or tights would be in order. After a few minutes of searching I saw something that interested me – a simple navy-blue singlet. My high school singlet was the only one I owned at that point, so I decided picking up another one wouldn’t be a bad idea. I ended up using it in one road race, but it was quickly replaced by a different singlet and collected dust in my closet until I brought it to Maryland with me.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 2 – The Paint</strong></p>\r\nThe date was September 1, 2018. The location was College Park, Maryland. I entered a convenience store with my roommate called North Convenience. I had recently moved into my dorm and my roommate and I decided to buy some masking tape to hang things up in our room with. We quickly found the isle containing all the tape and settled on a roll of white masking tape. Despite my protests, he ended up paying the entire cost. However, the tape was ineffective at sticking to the wall and the roll ended up at the bottom of some drawer.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 3 – Rendition One… The Birth of a Meme</strong></p>\r\n              Shortly after joining the running club, we ordered apparel that included an official club running singlet. However, the apparel was not expected to arrive until a couple of weeks before nationals. There was the option to rent a singlet from the club, but for an unknown reason this did not appeal to me. As the first meet of the season approached, I decided to use my original navy-blue singlet. Quickly, I realized that it had absolutely no Maryland spirit, so I bought a pair of Maryland flag shorts from Amazon. The day before Paul Short while I was packing my bag, I decided that the flag shorts were not enough, and I had a Eureka moment. I searched through a drawer until I found that reject roll of tape that failed to stick to the walls, and I applied a simple masking tape “M” to the front of the singlet. After stepping back and admiring my creation from afar I decided to add a line under the M. Once I finished the line, rendition one of the homemade singlet was complete.\r\n\r\nThe reveal of the first home-made singlet at the start line of Paul Short went well. Overall people seemed to like it. However, Mitch informed me that It looked like a Michigan singlet. This observation was valid as Michigan also has navy blue singlets with an M on the front. The realization that I had unwittingly represented the wrong team weighed heavily on my soul throughout the race and the weeks that followed. I was determined to return to the next race with an improved version.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 4 – Rendition Two… The Sting of Failure</strong></p>\r\n              Throughout the two weeks leading up to the second meet of the season I reflected on the lessons I had learned at Paul Short. I thought long and hard on what I could do to improve the singlet every day. Many ideas crossed my mind such as printing out a picture of the Maryland flag and taping it to the jersey. However, this idea, and all the others, were tacky and stupid. Before I knew it, the night before Princeton had arrived and I had no ideas. I decided to scroll through pictures of college team singlets for inspiration and saw multiple designs with words going down the back. This was quite aesthetically pleasing so I decided to implement it into rendition two. I started the creation process with the same “M” with a line underneath on the front. Next, I made a “MARYLAND” running along the back of the singlet vertically by cutting strips of tape in half. It took a few tries to get the placement and sizing right, but the result was beautiful.\r\n\r\nI wore the second home-made singlet to the meet and revealed it right before the warm up. The reveal was a huge success as everyone was a big fan of the MARYLAND addition. Pride and happiness carried me through a great warm up. However, when we returned to our area after the warm up I was informed that all the letters on the back were falling off. I looked down at my chest and noticed the M was failing as well. Shock and despair filled my mind and heart instantly. I had no choice but to remove the MARYLAND. Elliot helped my repair the M with some safety pins and more tape. Unfortunately, we had to sacrifice good looks for structural integrity. While we were standing at the start line Briggs looked at what had become of the singlet. I cannot recall his exact words, but the general idea was that I was a disgrace to the University of Maryland and the team. Each kilometer of that 8k race was dedicated to one of the letters that fell off my back.\r\n\r\nThe night after that race was hard. I wondered if I was cut out for making singlets. I questioned what I was working towards. Was this a dream that I was chasing, or just time that I was wasting?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 5 – Rendition Three… The Singlet Stronger than its Creator</strong></p>\r\n              During the week between Princeton and NIRCA Regionals tragedy struck. I felt a pain in my left shin and would find out a few weeks later that it was a stress fracture, but at the time all I knew was that it hurt way too much to run on. Despite not being able to run I accompanied the team to regionals for moral support.  The day before regionals I decided to create a singlet and bring it just in case. However, the pain from my recent failure was still fresh and I only put the M with the line on it.\r\n\r\nWhile I was talking to Brian at the meet, he told me that he did not have a singlet. I happily gave him rendition three of the homemade singlet to use. Although I had succumbed to injury, my creation was going to continue to cross the finish line. Brian did not warm up in the singlet, and the tape ended up staying on fine. Through this meet I learned why I had failed at Princeton. The sweat from warming up in the singlet weakened the tape before the race even started.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong> </strong><strong>Chapter 6 – Rendition Four… The Game Changer</strong></p>\r\n<strong>              </strong>A few days before the UVA meet I was discussing the homemade singlet with Mike (DiDonato). He told me that he wanted to wear it, and I happily agreed to create another one. I was eager to apply what I had learned at regionals to rendition four of the singlet. The night before the meet I once again meticulously created a MARYLAND down the back.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the race I made sure that Mike did not warm up with the singlet. This day was the most fun I have ever had while spectating a cross country meet since nearly everyone was making a meme of it. I ended up giving a hype up speech, handing a slice of bread to Dan, Brian, and Elliot mid-race and handing a whole loaf of bread to MT. However, deep down beneath all the memes I was slightly nervous about the performance of the singlet. Heading to the start line, it was in perfect condition. The gun went off and I scrambled to my bread hand off positions throughout the course. About two miles into the race I saw Mike run by and was happy to see the MARYLAND was still intact. Next, I stood at about 500 meters to go and continued to hand out bread. Shortly, Mike came into view with someone in a unicorn costume in pursuit. As they passed I caught a glimpse of the MARYLAND still fully intact. I was nothing short of overjoyed. After a failure at Princeton that made me question everything, this victory was huge. Also, Mike out kicked the unicorn so we all won that day.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>CHAPTER 7 – Rendition Five… The Finale</strong></p>\r\n              As nationals approached, the club apparel arrived, including the singlets (they are amazing). Shortly after they arrived I decided that nationals would be the homemade singlet’s last race. It had served its purpose as a place holder and was beginning to show signs of wear and tear from its journey. There was a small hole forming in the back and there were permanent stains from the clay and mud of the UVA course. I wanted the final rendition to be the best one and considered many elaborate editions. However, I eventually settled on adding color to the tape for the first time. The night before we left for nationals, I spent a concerning amount of time drawing the Maryland flag design on the line of tape beneath the M with red, yellow, and black sharpies.\r\n\r\nThe night before nationals I was discussing the singlet with some guys and both Briggs and Craig offered to wear it. As it worked out during race day, Craig would be the one to take it across the finish line for the final time. I enjoyed watching all the races take place throughout the day, and unlike UVA I was not nervous about the performance of the singlet. I knew deep down that it would perform well on the national stage. After all it had been through, I had no doubt it would hold up.\r\n\r\nThe gun went off for the Freshman/Sophomore race and Craig set off carrying the singlet through its final 8k. It was admittedly hard to spot the singlet in the sea of runners, but we managed to pick it out in the crowd a few times. Each time we saw it everything was still intact, and this would remain true as Craig crossed the line. The singlet’s odyssey was complete. It had crossed the finish line of every race that season\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 8 – The Conclusion</strong></p>\r\nI find it quite poetic that a useless roll of tape and an unused singlet combined to make something so memorable and meaningful. Something that I will laugh at every time I see a roll of masking tape. Something that helped me bond with my teammates. I’ll miss spending an hour cutting and coloring tape, but this meme has run its course. Here’s to the next one.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Acknowledgements </strong></p>\r\n I would like to thank the people that made this possible. Thank you to Mitch and Briggs for encouraging me to improve my singlet when it did not live up to its full potential. Thank you to Brian, Mike, and Craig for taking it across the line when I couldn’t. Thank you to Lent and Hiro for documenting the singlet’s journey through photography. Finally, thank you to the club as a whole for the funnest (I firmly believe funnest should be a word) XC season of my life.', 'The Odyssey of a Homemade Singlet', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-odyssey-of-a-homemade-singlet', '', '', '2018-11-12 00:05:10', '2018-11-12 05:05:10', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=283', 0, 'post', '', 3),

Enjoy!\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you ask anyone close to me what they think my favorite part of college is, I guarantee you they won’t tell you all the homework, or exams, or even the ~crazy~ parties. They will tell you my favorite part of college is being a part of club running. And this answer is 100% right. Let me tell you why...</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think we need to back up a bit. Ever since I was young I have been a part of some sort of sport. For a long time it was soccer (which I still miss!) before I transitioned over to only focusing on running in high school. High school track and cross country was great. I met great friends (even my current boyfriend) and had loads of fun at meets. Because of this great experience, I was determined to keep running (especially doing so on some sort of a team) in my life on college. Enter Maryland club running!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freshman year is a confusing time, despite what some people’s Instagram might show. If you go out of state like me, you most likely know close to no one at your new school, and you’re just trying to find ways to pass the time until class starts. Like I said, I was eager to keep a running team in my life, so through my summer research I had already found and contacted the running club at university of Maryland. From the day I arrived on campus, I was counting down the days until the first practice. Before we go any further, let’s get something straight. I am NOT an outgoing person when I first meet someone. So something I’ve loved about sports my whole life is that it’s basically a bunch of instant friends! You spend hours together each day until you feel comfortable with each other without even realizing it happened. When I went to practice that first day, I was hoping I found “my people”. At first I stuck around because everyone was nice, I liked running, and I liked the structure it added to my day. I didn’t talk much, but was content just being there and listening to the chatter on group runs. Practice provides a guaranteed 2ish hours of stress relief each day. I can’t quite pinpoint when it happened, but eventually there’s was a different reason why I kept sticking around. Don’t get me wrong, the people are still nice, I still like running, and I still like the structure it adds to my day, but there’s more now. I truly understand club running now. This wonderful sport manages to combine the best aspects of running with the best aspects of club sports to produce (in my opinion) the best activity you can participate in, and here are my top 5 reasons why:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s FUN: A few weekends ago we ran a race, and it was one of the freshman’s first cross country races ever. I saw her cross the line with a big smile on her face and she later told me how fun the entire meet was. Despite the pain racing inevitably causes, it really is fun to push yourself to your limits and see progress throughout the season.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nobody takes themselves too seriously: Club running meets are never short on shenanigans. Will people be running in costumes? Yep (I once witnessed two girls run an entire race in the RAIN in dinosaur costumes, that’s some serious dedication). Will one of your races be started by a didgeridoo? You bet. Will your team get a pumpkin full of candy for placing in the top few teams? Only if you’re lucky! (and yes we’ve been lucky enough for that). And finally, yes. You might just catch someone cheering with a loaf of bread in one hand and an ear of corn in the other.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The competition is there if you want it: Even with all of the fun, NIRCA (the National Intercollegiate club running association) is still extremely competitive if that’s your thing. If not, no worries! You’re more than welcome to hobby jog in the back of the pack. But for those looking to see how much faster they can go, club running has the competition to push you to a new personal best.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fun trips with your friends: Sometimes to find the competition you have to travel a little bit, which means… overnight meets! Yes, basically a big sleepover with your friends with some running on the side! Okay, maybe the running is the main event but sometimes the stay in hotel is just as fun. Where do we travel you might ask? Last year we traveled by van all the way out to East Lansing Michigan to compete in the NIRCA cross country national championships. Oh man was it cold, (or hot who for those who caught on fire… ask Shannon for details) but it was SO worth it. We got to compete against clubs from all over the country, cheer on our teammates, run some fast races, and have a fun weekend not worrying about school.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The people: My 5th and most important reason is the wonderful people. First, the people from other teams. They’re supposed to be the competition, right?? You might be racing each other, but we all still encourage each other during races and congratulate each other on a race well run. I will never forget when I lapped a girl from another team in a track race and she cheered me on BY NAME as I ran by. If that isn’t true sportsmanship, then I don’t know what is. Now about my own teammates. My teammates have become my best friends (some even my roommates). They’ve taken me on my first backpacking trip, introduced me to the world that is bubble tea, and showed me how to be genuinely excited for each other\'s triumphs and be supportive them when they fall. </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hope you get the point because I think I’ve gone on for long enough.

Will one of your races be started by a didgeridoo? You bet. Will your team get a pumpkin full of candy for placing in the top few teams? Only if you’re lucky! (and yes we’ve been lucky enough for that). And finally, yes. You might just catch someone cheering with a loaf of bread in one hand and an ear of corn in the other.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The competition is there if you want it: Even with all of the fun, NIRCA (the National Intercollegiate club running association) is still extremely competitive if that’s your thing. If not, no worries! You’re more than welcome to hobby jog in the back of the pack. But for those looking to see how much faster they can go, club running has the competition to push you to a new personal best.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fun trips with your friends: Sometimes to find the competition you have to travel a little bit, which means… overnight meets! Yes, basically a big sleepover with your friends with some running on the side! Okay, maybe the running is the main event but sometimes the stay in hotel is just as fun. Where do we travel you might ask? Last year we traveled by van all the way out to East Lansing Michigan to compete in the NIRCA cross country national championships. Oh man was it cold, (or hot who for those who caught on fire… ask Shannon for details) but it was SO worth it. We got to compete against clubs from all over the country, cheer on our teammates, run some fast races, and have a fun weekend not worrying about school.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The people: My 5th and most important reason is the wonderful people. First, the people from other teams. They’re supposed to be the competition, right?? You might be racing each other, but we all still encourage each other during races and congratulate each other on a race well run. I will never forget when I lapped a girl from another team in a track race and she cheered me on BY NAME as I ran by. If that isn’t true sportsmanship, then I don’t know what is. Now about my own teammates. My teammates have become my best friends (some even my roommates). They’ve taken me on my first backpacking trip, introduced me to the world that is bubble tea, and showed me how to be genuinely excited for each other\'s triumphs and be supportive them when they fall. </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hope you get the point because I think I’ve gone on for long enough.

The location was Thousand Oaks, California. I entered a running store with my aunt and mother called Roadrunner Sports. My aunt lives in California and she decided to celebrate my first time visiting her out there with a trip to this store. She told me that she would buy me a pair of shoes and a clothing item of my choice. First, I scoured the shoe display searching for something with decent support and cushioning for longer mileage. Eventually, I settled on the Brooks Levitates. (I used these shoes through out indoor and outdoor track that year. They were ok, but I hear the Brooks Levitate 2s aren’t the same.) Next, I began to rummage through the clothing isles waiting for something to catch my eye. I thought perhaps a new pair of split shorts or tights would be in order. After a few minutes of searching I saw something that interested me – a simple navy-blue singlet. My high school singlet was the only one I owned at that point, so I decided picking up another one wouldn’t be a bad idea. I ended up using it in one road race, but it was quickly replaced by a different singlet and collected dust in my closet until I brought it to Maryland with me.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 2 – The Paint</strong></p>\r\nThe date was September 1, 2018. The location was College Park, Maryland. I entered a convenience store with my roommate called North Convenience. I had recently moved into my dorm and my roommate and I decided to buy some masking tape to hang things up in our room with. We quickly found the isle containing all the tape and settled on a roll of white masking tape. Despite my protests, he ended up paying the entire cost. However, the tape was ineffective at sticking to the wall and the roll ended up at the bottom of some drawer.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 3 – Rendition One… The Birth of a Meme</strong></p>\r\n              Shortly after joining the running club, we ordered apparel that included an official club running singlet. However, the apparel was not expected to arrive until a couple of weeks before nationals. There was the option to rent a singlet from the club, but for an unknown reason this did not appeal to me. As the first meet of the season approached, I decided to use my original navy-blue singlet. Quickly, I realized that it had absolutely no Maryland spirit, so I bought a pair of Maryland flag shorts from Amazon. The day before Paul Short while I was packing my bag, I decided that the flag shorts were not enough, and I had a Eureka moment. I searched through a drawer until I found that reject roll of tape that failed to stick to the walls, and I applied a simple masking tape “M” to the front of the singlet. After stepping back and admiring my creation from afar I decided to add a line under the M. Once I finished the line, rendition one of the homemade singlet was complete.\r\n\r\nThe reveal of the first home-made singlet at the start line of Paul Short went well. Overall people seemed to like it. However, Mitch informed me that It looked like a Michigan singlet. This observation was valid as Michigan also has navy blue singlets with an M on the front. The realization that I had unwittingly represented the wrong team weighed heavily on my soul throughout the race and the weeks that followed. I was determined to return to the next race with an improved version.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 4 – Rendition Two… The Sting of Failure</strong></p>\r\n              Throughout the two weeks leading up to the second meet of the season I reflected on the lessons I had learned at Paul Short. I thought long and hard on what I could do to improve the singlet every day. Many ideas crossed my mind such as printing out a picture of the Maryland flag and taping it to the jersey. However, this idea, and all the others, were tacky and stupid. Before I knew it, the night before Princeton had arrived and I had no ideas. I decided to scroll through pictures of college team singlets for inspiration and saw multiple designs with words going down the back. This was quite aesthetically pleasing so I decided to implement it into rendition two. I started the creation process with the same “M” with a line underneath on the front. Next, I made a “MARYLAND” running along the back of the singlet vertically by cutting strips of tape in half. It took a few tries to get the placement and sizing right, but the result was beautiful.\r\n\r\nI wore the second home-made singlet to the meet and revealed it right before the warm up. The reveal was a huge success as everyone was a big fan of the MARYLAND addition. Pride and happiness carried me through a great warm up. However, when we returned to our area after the warm up I was informed that all the letters on the back were falling off. I looked down at my chest and noticed the M was failing as well. Shock and despair filled my mind and heart instantly. I had no choice but to remove the MARYLAND. Elliot helped my repair the M with some safety pins and more tape. Unfortunately, we had to sacrifice good looks for structural integrity. While we were standing at the start line Briggs looked at what had become of the singlet. I cannot recall his exact words, but the general idea was that I was a disgrace to the University of Maryland and the team. Each kilometer of that 8k race was dedicated to one of the letters that fell off my back.\r\n\r\nThe night after that race was hard. I wondered if I was cut out for making singlets. I questioned what I was working towards. Was this a dream that I was chasing, or just time that I was wasting?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 5 – Rendition Three… The Singlet Stronger than its Creator</strong></p>\r\n              During the week between Princeton and NIRCA Regionals tragedy struck. I felt a pain in my left shin and would find out a few weeks later that it was a stress fracture, but at the time all I knew was that it hurt way too much to run on. Despite not being able to run I accompanied the team to regionals for moral support.  The day before regionals I decided to create a singlet and bring it just in case. However, the pain from my recent failure was still fresh and I only put the M with the line on it.\r\n\r\nWhile I was talking to Brian at the meet, he told me that he did not have a singlet. I happily gave him rendition three of the homemade singlet to use. Although I had succumbed to injury, my creation was going to continue to cross the finish line. Brian did not warm up in the singlet, and the tape ended up staying on fine. Through this meet I learned why I had failed at Princeton. The sweat from warming up in the singlet weakened the tape before the race even started.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong> </strong><strong>Chapter 6 – Rendition Four… The Game Changer</strong></p>\r\n<strong>              </strong>A few days before the UVA meet I was discussing the homemade singlet with Mike (DiDonato). He told me that he wanted to wear it, and I happily agreed to create another one. I was eager to apply what I had learned at regionals to rendition four of the singlet. The night before the meet I once again meticulously created a MARYLAND down the back.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the race I made sure that Mike did not warm up with the singlet. This day was the most fun I have ever had while spectating a cross country meet since nearly everyone was making a meme of it. I ended up giving a hype up speech, handing a slice of bread to Dan, Brian, and Elliot mid-race and handing a whole loaf of bread to MT. However, deep down beneath all the memes I was slightly nervous about the performance of the singlet. Heading to the start line, it was in perfect condition. The gun went off and I scrambled to my bread hand off positions throughout the course. About two miles into the race I saw Mike run by and was happy to see the MARYLAND was still intact. Next, I stood at about 500 meters to go and continued to hand out bread. Shortly, Mike came into view with someone in a unicorn costume in pursuit. As they passed I caught a glimpse of the MARYLAND still fully intact. I was nothing short of overjoyed. After a failure at Princeton that made me question everything, this victory was huge. Also, Mike out kicked the unicorn so we all won that day.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>CHAPTER 7 – Rendition Five… The Finale</strong></p>\r\n              As nationals approached, the club apparel arrived, including the singlets (they are amazing). Shortly after they arrived I decided that nationals would be the homemade singlet’s last race. It had served its purpose as a place holder and was beginning to show signs of wear and tear from its journey. There was a small hole forming in the back and there were permanent stains from the clay and mud of the UVA course. I wanted the final rendition to be the best one and considered many elaborate editions. However, I eventually settled on adding color to the tape for the first time. The night before we left for nationals, I spent a concerning amount of time drawing the Maryland flag design on the line of tape beneath the M with red, yellow, and black sharpies.\r\n\r\nThe night before nationals I was discussing the singlet with some guys and both Briggs and Craig offered to wear it. As it worked out during race day, Craig would be the one to take it across the finish line for the final time. I enjoyed watching all the races take place throughout the day, and unlike UVA I was not nervous about the performance of the singlet. I knew deep down that it would perform well on the national stage. After all it had been through, I had no doubt it would hold up.\r\n\r\nThe gun went off for the Freshman/Sophomore race and Craig set off carrying the singlet through its final 8k. It was admittedly hard to spot the singlet in the sea of runners, but we managed to pick it out in the crowd a few times. Each time we saw it everything was still intact, and this would remain true as Craig crossed the line. The singlet’s odyssey was complete. It had crossed the finish line of every race that season\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 8 – The Conclusion</strong></p>\r\nI find it quite poetic that a useless roll of tape and an unused singlet combined to make something so memorable and meaningful. Something that I will laugh at every time I see a roll of masking tape. Something that helped me bond with my teammates. I’ll miss spending an hour cutting and coloring tape, but this meme has run its course. Here’s to the next one.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Acknowledgements </strong></p>\r\n I would like to thank the people that made this possible. Thank you to Mitch and Briggs for encouraging me to improve my singlet when it did not live up to its full potential. Thank you to Brian, Mike, and Craig for taking it across the line when I couldn’t. Thank you to Lent and Hiro for documenting the singlet’s journey through photography.

And while I enjoy shitting on the state that gave us Snooki and Kris Kristy just as much as the next guy I feel the need to at least attempt a defense of the state that my roommate lives in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirst need I mention the teams best meet from last XC season was in New Jersey and next to Princeton no less? That’s right the state that you hate also gave our team the XC course that allowed people to smash PRs (including a new club record from Shannon), get called to the podium for the first time and for the men’s team a well deserved victory, which destroyed the now tattered name of Princeton’s running club. But even after our victory was announced the men’s club at Princeton humbly acknowledged their Beta male status and kneeled before our immense superiority, a testament to their hospitality and grace in the face of humiliation. This hospitality lays in stark contrast to how many describe New Jerseyans as a-holes and jerks.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso while we may compare Jersey to waste that pollutes the good name of America I would like to point out that Wawa litters their entire state. This great American franchise is not just where New Jerseyans get 100% of there gas and 80% of there food, instead it would be more accurate to describe it as part of there lifestyle and who can really blame a whole state for falling for a store that serves high quality sandwiches 24/7. On a personal note any store that challenges McDonalds (the only store I’ve maintained a lifetime boycott of) monopoly on the lucrative 2am drunk food market has my full support.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow I’ve saved this for last, because I know that it’s what we all truly hate the most about Jersey: the tolls. Driving through New Jersey is like using your fake at Bentleys. First you have to buy the car/fake then you have to pay for gas/alcohol for the pregame then you have to pay the toll/cover fee and then you have to pay for the overpriced shit inside New Jersey’s gas/drinks at the bar. Now to be truthful when I remembered the tolls I stopped writing this blog post then xed out and was about to hit don’t save with they intention of resining myself to hate New Jersey for the rest of my life, until I remembered one very important thing. It wasn’t New Jersey that built these interstate highways and their annoying tollbooths it was the federal government.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking what the problem with the federal government was and then I remembered something Nate told me a while back “Rhode Island is a completely useless state and should be annexed by Connecticut immediately.” This here is the real problem with America. Small states like Rhode Island get two self righteous senators who think they know what the country needs despite both of them representing only 0.3% of the population.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTherefore as of today the office of treasury is proposing a new state for the finest club east of the Mississippi to shit on. The completely useless, utterly irrelevant, and just insignificant state of Rhode Island. A state founded by a radical outcast of Massachusetts, who didn’t even have the decency to flee for the frontier like every other self respecting outlaw in our nations history. Switching our shit on state to Rhode Island will also remove any hard feelings that may be harbored by some of our clubs most treasured members who call New Jersey home (the Mulleted Mike DiDonato).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition unlike our clubs unstructured hate of New Jersey, Nate and I have an end goal in mind, to give our hate a meaning and mission. That goal is to eradicate the scourge of Rhode Island with a needed act of political courage and nobility, which will be fulfilled in due time. I give you Nate’s righteous proposal.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Annexation of Rhode Island\r\n\r\nBy: Nate Lieske\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany people seem to have a positive perception of the irrational state that is Rhode Island. It will be my goal here today to change their minds.\r\n\r\nRhode Island can be compared to a tumultuous tumor growing to the east of Connecticut. It drains life from my home state with promises of beautiful beaches, but in reality it is nothing more than a disgusting growth. Rhode Islanders are reluctant to inform visitors that their coastline holds the shameful position of 5<sup>th</sup> worst water quality amongst states with beaches. Connecticut stands at a respectable 12<sup>th</sup> out of the 30 states with beaches. These facts reveal that Rhode Island has essentially stolen much of Connecticut’s coastline and polluted it beyond repair.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people are undeterred by the idea of swimming in filth. However, how would those people enjoy risking life, limb, and property on their way to these waste infested waterfronts? Rhode Island is ranked 48th in infrastructure quality when compared to all 50 states. While driving through its precarious roads you will encounter potholes deep enough to be the setting of Jules Verne’s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>. Connecticut sits at an impressive 24<sup>th</sup>.\r\n\r\nConnecticut is clearly more proficient at maintaining its infrastructure and waterways than Rhode Island is. Everyone in both states would be better off if they were to merge. What would the name of this “new” state be? Connecticut. My home state would be investing billions of dollars into a nearly hopeless wasteland. They will not tarnish our name. Puerto Rico could then join the union so we do not have to redesign the flag or lose two senators.\r\n\r\nI am hereby calling for our club to come together and move on from our hate of New Jersey. There’s a smaller, but much more rancid fish to fry now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe hope that this blog, written mostly because we have nothing better to do, but also because we emphatically believe this change in our clubs core values is needed, has convinced you to join us in changing the state we hate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWater Quality Stats: <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/how-does-your-state-rank-for-beach-water-quality-1881929051.html\">https://www.ecowatch.com/how-does-your-state-rank-for-beach-water-quality-1881929051.html</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRoad Quality Stats: <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings\">https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings</a>', 'A Joint Message from the Office of the Treasury', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-joint-message-from-the-office-of-the-treasury', '', '', '2019-02-01 15:05:12', '2019-02-01 20:05:12', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=313', 0, 'post', '', 2),

Well their rivalries command a certain place in our hearts. From bloody Peloponnesian conflict to good old fashion western shootouts each of these rivalries have been balanced for centuries as if Justice herself has blindly held the scale. What rivalry do we not see among the pantheon of great debates? Oh, that’s right, Running2Win vs. Strava! Usually I take the high road citing my favorite author Samuel Clemens “Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.” But I find in this extreme circumstance I can no longer stand by while an oppressive regime seeks to dilute the sacrosanct weekly email in favor of a Running2Win agenda. Put plainly Strava’s superiority is unmatched by any of its peers. According to a source close to the company “They [Strava] have the best interns!” My source also stated that “They [Strava] have a public facing API that any runner can work with and make their own cool stats.” While I am but a lowly dual degree even I can fathom that a public facing API as presented by Strava vastly out does the complicated and distorted product presented by Running2Win. But maybe you don’t mind! Perhaps you can wade through the disgusting soup that congregates upon your internet explorer browser window. So instead of citing the cold hard facts, as many of my fake news counterparts might do, let me present instead a personal anecdote. Last year as a young and eager Freshman I signed up on Running2Win. I then connected the abomination to my Strava therefore allowing both runs and bike rides to be automatically uploaded. While I will spare the gruesome details I, through no fault of my own, ended up on the leaderboards of Running2Win. Some might claim I was cheating hastily pointing out the suspicious patterns of my mercurial fitness. All I can say is the amount of disgusting and upsetting hate mail I received was downright overwhelming. All 2 messages as well as the forum post about myself were thoroughly disheartening. But fear not for I found solace in a community of Cyclists, Triathletes, Skiers, and Runners on a beautiful platform known as Strava. So where do you fit in? Maybe you’re a perspective member, wily alumni, seasoned vet, auspicious newcomer, or curious parent. Your social status does not matter in so far as I have already provided a universal answer. This is not a question of Coke Vs. Pepsi or Marvel vs. DC the debate over Running2Win vs. Strava is nonexistent. Strava is the answer. And so, I challenge you to ask not what Strava can do for you!

(292, 33, '2018-11-17 23:51:32', '2018-11-18 04:51:32', '<h2>By Colin SyBing</h2>\r\nDear UMD Club Running,\r\n\r\nAs I write this, it’s almost midnight on Sunday November 11<sup>th </sup>(though it’ll probably be much longer before I finish). More specifically, I’ve just emerged from a post-Nationals car ride coma, checked the grade I received on the midterm I took right before leaving last week (eh), commented on a couple of Andrew Lent’s meme-y photos from the meet, and already begun experiencing NIRCA withdrawal. But, as I reflect on yet another wonderful weekend full of running, inside jokes, and absurdly cold weather, I can’t help but feel a bit emotional and look back at the past half year. If you’ll indulge me, I’d like to look back on the past six months and share my experiences with the team and take a moment to think about the future. That’s right; kick back and choose your favorite assignment to procrastinate on, because it’s gonna be a long blog post. Let’s reminisce.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Anti-Climax</h4>\r\nAs I rounded out the final, ~90-meter straightaway at UMD’s very own Kehoe Track, I glanced at the clock to confirm the suspicion in the back of my mind. For the umpteenth time in my career as a 1500m/mile runner, I had led the race only to been outkicked in the last 200m by some guy with better leg speed and a smarter racing strategy. Despite what Prefontaine might tell you, running boldly doesn’t always pay off when you can’t kick. But that wasn’t what stung the most. What stung, deep within my throbbing chest as a slight drizzle began to fall down on the track that Friday night in May, was that ever since a thrilling 4:01 PR a month prior, I had failed to reach my season goal of breaking 4 minutes in the 1500m, a goal I held ever since entering college.\r\n\r\nI puked up the 251 dinner I had 3 hours prior into a nearby trashcan as my father came on to the field to congratulate me on my fantastic 5k race (my father, to this day, doesn’t know how long a track is). Regretfully, I looked up at the varsity athletes setting up to run the fast heat of the 1500m, the cut for which I unfortunately did not make. I couldn’t help but feel another pang of disappointment as I realized that my season had just ended, and ended in such an unceremonious fashion. No more interval workouts, no more lacing up spikes, no more laughing at kids with horrible form with Jacob from the stands. Yet another year of running completed, and yet I was still left without that sense of climactic achievement: the bursting sensation of finally smashing that goal that you’ve been working towards for months. Nothing. Zip. No ceremony, no inner satisfaction, no victorious spirit left for some club kid that got outkicked in the slow heat at a varsity meet.\r\n\r\nI shuffled through a short, rainy cooldown jog as I prepared to cheer on my teammates for the 5k. As I awaited the starting gun for the final event of the night, I began mentally mapping out the next couple months. “Build up your mileage, stay consistent, get the strength training in, hit the midsummer tempos, and then you guys will have your shot at a great nationals finish.” It was all so simple. Nothing could possibly go wrong. My planning was cut short as I was tasked with shrieking at my teammates in the rain for 12.5 laps around our stupidly proportioned track, but I knew that, despite my disappointment today, my teammates and I had a shot at working on something great, and that alone was enough to lift my spirits: a belief in a better tomorrow.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">The Long Summer Months</h4>\r\nAfter a week of finals preparation, summer goodbyes, and, most notably, no running, it was time for a very special part of the year: summer training. Everything’s hot, everything’s long, and everything’s possible. This year, unlike past years, we had clear goals and an ambitious training plan from everyone’s personal life coach, Jack Wavering. Hit the miles, do the workouts, make the podium at Nats. Simple. Elegant. Genius. Not only did we have an A-1 training plan, but we had some bomb-ass plans to follow it. With a large portion of the boys team still in and around College Park and the move in date for an infamous non-club-associated house just on the horizon, we didn’t just have a training plan, we had a <strong>training team</strong>, a luxury not many college teams possess.\r\n\r\nAnd boy was it a blast. Through three and a half summer months of torturous summer class, a music festival, World Cup matches, trips to the beach, a shitty half-internship that I still haven’t been paid for, counseling at a summer running camp, and a trip to Canada, through heat warnings, 100% humidity, thunderstorms, early mornings and late nights, over concrete, dirt paths, but mostly concrete, I powered (and sometimes trudged) my way through summer miles alongside my teammates, my roommates, and my best friends. New routes were constructed, running playlists were carefully designed, and friendships were strengthened. My team was with me every step of the way as we all strove towards that Nationals podium, with tens of salty core sessions, hundreds of rounds of Contact, and most likely thousands of popsicles.\r\n\r\nAnd from what I saw on the greatest running log site known to man, the 8809 group was not the only one putting in great efforts. At the end of long days in a classroom, I would pull up running2win to read tales of heroes, tales of Katrina waking up before sunrise to run before work, of Elliot pumping up his mileage and quickening his pace during his first year of summer training, of Sarah and Julia driving across Maryland to find a place to run together, of Christina fighting to return from a nasty injury in the spring, of Ryun running multiple times each day at blindingly quick paces, and of Shannon running even faster than Ryun because why the hell not? Each of these teammates, and all the others that unfortunately use Strava like hobby joggers, were all working for the success of the team and for themselves, embodying what I believe to be truly beautiful about our sport. It was these people, the people who were forced into bad situations but fought to reach their goals anyway, who faced great adversity and simply didn’t care, who inspired me when my training was at its toughest, and for that I thank everyone (and running2win).\r\n\r\nEach day, I got faster, leaner, and more confident as I logged the hardest miles I think I’ve ever run in my life. Capping it all off in August with two consecutive 70-mile weeks (my highest mileage weeks ever), I strode into the school year with the utmost confidence in myself and my team, with just shy of 800 summer miles on my legs and legs of my teammates to back it all up. This was it. This was our year. After two years of not living up to the potential of our training due to nagging injuries and generally unfocused goals, we were waltzing into Fall of 2018 with a <strong>goddamn squad</strong>.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">New Beginnings and New Successes</h4>\r\nThe semester started off quick and chaotic like normal. Classes are hard, finding time to run is difficult, apparently you have to start applying for jobs in September, and there’s a whole new crop of names and majors to memorize. Nevertheless, it was clear, at least to me, that this year had a different vibe to it. I felt more focused, more motivated, and generally in higher spirits. My morale was further bolstered by the arrival of a fantastic class of new club members, some with stories that’ll make you laugh hours after you hear them, some with impressive running accolades, and all of them with positive, cheerful, motivated attitudes that I certainly wish I had as a freshman entering a new environment. Everything was lining up perfectly, and everyone around me seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves, something I think we can take for granted when semesters get busy.\r\n\r\nFrom September to mid-October, I felt invincible. It just seemed like everything was going right; my classes were interesting but not too tough, I had a couple internship interviews lined up, and my EWB project was getting off the ground, but to be honest, any joy I took from those paled in comparison to how I felt when I ran with this team. To paraphrase Mitch, “Literally nothing else matters as long as you’re fit.” And he was right. No matter how long a day I had or how sleep-deprived I became, I had trump card for happiness; I was fit and I had a great group of people to run with. Some personal highlights of my semester include (but are not limited to):\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>A 6:30AM 20 x 400m with Mitch followed by a 7AM Lumberjack with Mitch two weeks after</li>\r\n 	<li>Running at 9PM on a Monday with Jack only to be outrun by a guy in jeans who was late for his shift at Blaze</li>\r\n 	<li>Running a mile with Elliot and MT while finishing a freezy-pop on the first day of practice</li>\r\n 	<li>Nearly losing a time trial to some random freshman</li>\r\n 	<li>The Toga Party</li>\r\n 	<li>Finally running a decent race at Paul Short at my 4<sup>th</sup> time at that stupid course\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Hearing about Andrew and Mitchell’s race after that and subsequently crying of laughter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n 	<li>Styling on the IM soccer field during our most successful season yet (long live Yeet City)</li>\r\n 	<li>Following MT on a run of 20+ guys to PG Plaza that somehow turned into Riverdale, because all routes are actually just Riverdale</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">A Glorious Day: Princeton</h4>\r\nWith two races under our belts by mid-October, it seemed as though our third would be spoiled by some unforeseen circumstances. The Princeton Invitational, the historically fastest meet of the year and fastest course on the east coast (unless you’re a girl), had its existence come into question due to “construction” on the course. How you perform construction on a cornfield literally two days after the varsity meet at the same course remains a mystery to me, but I’ll give the meet coordinators the benefit of the doubt on this one. There was talk of rescheduling and cancelling, talk of moving the meet, and talk of going to the *shudders* Georgetown Invite instead. The uncertainty was absolutely maddening.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Princeton’s Running Club, led by a really fast leprechaun, that girl that doesn’t know how to read results, a sentient didgeridoo, and Jacob’s boyfriend, found an alternate course at a park in New Jersey. With bright eyes and high hopes, we set off for New Jersey on an early Sunday morning, and were rewarded with perfect weather, great competition, and, most importantly, the <em>actual </em>fastest course on the east coast. My Lord this park was like cross country heaven, mainly because it was nothing like a cross country course; not a single hill could be seen and 80% of the race was run on a crushed gravel path.\r\n\r\nThe girls raced first, and the results could not have been more encouraging. People were PR’ing left and right, shaving multiple minutes off their fastest times. People were so excited that it seemed as if the air itself was electric. I could hardly contain myself as the girl’s race wrapped up and I began warming up. Today was going to be great, I could feel it. My chest swelled with excitement as I was rudely photographed doing my leg extensions on the start line once again. As always, Ryun graced us with a wonderful pump up speech about turtles and defense and whatnot and we strode back to the line.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the gun went off, I flew out to the front to dodge traffic at the first bottleneck. Despite some later chastising from Ryun, I thought I was off to a dream start. As the first mile wore on, I allowed a group of 10-11 leaders to move up ahead. For someone who usually chases the leaders, an odd calm had settled over me. Maybe it was the hyperventilating guy in sneakers and a T-shirt that sprinted ahead of me to chase the leaders that told me that some of the guys in front of me were likely to drop back eventually. I rolled through the first mile with the leaders still in my sights, not bothering to check a watch or listen for anyone yelling out a split; I knew it was fast. Calmly, I decided to maintain my following distance until the third mile before making any bold moves, and as I made that decision something miraculous happened. Mitch came up on my shoulder, barely breathing. I was already determined to race well, but there’s something about racing next to a teammate that you’ve known for years, matching strides, knowing that you both feel good that makes you think “Let’s. Fucking. <em>Go</em>.”\r\n\r\nMitch and I ran stride for stride for the next 3 miles, watching utter carnage unfold in front of us. The leaders were dropping like flies. One by one, overly ambitious athletes faded from the front pack, only to be surrounded and passed by Mitch and me on either side, never to be seen again. Soon, we hit the grass by the start for the final time, meaning that we had just a bit less than a mile to go. I focused my eyes 30m forward on my next victim: the dubious individual known solely as “Princeton Guy.” At this moment, a sliver of doubt crawled into my mind for the first time. This guy was older and more talented than I was. I watched this guy lead the Mid-Atlantic Regional race one year ago from 50<sup>th</sup> or so place. If I even got close to catching him, he’d most likely just outkick me. Maybe this was it. Maybe my luck had run out. Maybe it was time to settle and cruise to the finish. But as Princeton Guy rounded a turn about 30m ahead of me, he did something that melted any fear out of me.\r\n\r\nHe looked over his shoulder, straight at me. He was scared.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, I became a different runner. My hips were no longer dropped. My stride lengthened ever so slightly but my feet were leaving the ground faster than before. My arms were pumping harder and my eyes were glued squarely on the shoulders of my newest competitor. I was bounding closer, closer, and closer still with every stride. This runner who I had previously classified as completely out of my range, totally above my paygrade, was moving back to me in slow motion. Ten seconds later, he was a thing of the past. I blew by him with a kilometer to go, and soon I put another runner behind me as well right before making a hard right onto the final straightaway.\r\n\r\nEyes focused straight ahead, I saw Ryun’s back in the distance. Ryun, who consistently ran workouts twice as long as I did (and way faster too). Ryun, whose running logs made my eyes pop out of my head. Ryun, the guy who I watched score a bronze medal at track nationals six months prior. That guy was in my sights. Maybe it’s rude to say this about a teammate, but I can tell you honestly that I’ve rarely felt a stronger urge to accelerate than I did in that moment. 600m or so later, and it was all over. I had closed my following distance to a meager 10 meters, and as I leaned over the line, I craned my neck to the left to see the clock.\r\n\r\n<em>Holy shit.</em> 25:30 and change. I didn’t even have time to calculate that as a 70 second PR before my teammates started streaming across the finish line behind me. Mitch flew in right behind me, and then Brian blazed into the chute, followed soon after by a hard-kicking Rylan and Jack, and in that moment I let out what could only be described as a primal scream. This was <em>it</em>. Not only did we have this meet in the bag for the second year in a row, but we did it in triumphant fashion. Scorching fast times aside, we had run together perfectly, and dominated a rival team that had blown us out of the water at Regionals and Nationals last year.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was a blur of congratulations, granola bar fueled sprints (courtesy of the long-missed Matt Patsy), and victorious devouring of free food. The crowd of parents and athletes gathered around a picnic table to read out results, and for the first time in 3 years, I stepped up to receive an award on a cross country podium. More importantly, the girls’ team earned a podium finish and the boys’ team was announced as the returning champs. For me though, more important than any time or place or celebratory rubber duck, was the return of a feeling long-lost. For the first time in a very long while, that bursting swell of accomplishment, that pride, that primal joy of knowing that on this day, I laid everything out on the course and performed at my best, that I truly <em>became</em> the best version of myself, that feeling returned. What I was missing at the Kehoe Invite last May, what I fell short of during cross season last Fall, and what I spent long summer months fighting to reclaim, was finally mine again. And with Regionals a week away, I wanted more.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Obstacles</h4>\r\nRegionals. Oh boy. I had a personal history of completely blowing it on this course. Team-wise, for the past two years, we’ve strode up to Lehigh with the intent of walking away with the trophy. In both my years on this team, we’ve managed to find a brand-new source of swagger right before this weekend, whether it’s a post-Lumberjack pump up speech from Ceruzzi or a strong team performance at Princeton. This year was no different, and the background audio on a certain video on NIRCA’s Instagram from that week will confirm the presence of some cockiness. In past years though, it never worked out. We, specifically the boys’ team, always ended up blowing up or underperforming (aside from some unofficial race results stemming from a course mishap last year).\r\n\r\nFor anyone who can read results, it’s no secret that that trend continued this year. Some things happened out on those Lehigh hills that happened yet this season. People burnt out early, fatigue showed on the legs of many, and the killer instinct necessary to succeed in an 8k was nowhere to be found. The boys and girls each finished 4<sup>th</sup>, and while I would later chalk up this less than stellar performance to the fact that we trained through the meet (as opposed to other teams who may have designed a small peak into their training plan at the expense of a sharper peak at nationals), I couldn’t help but walk away from Lehigh with a sour taste in my mouth, though I suppose it’s hard not to get frustrated with the dystopian echoes of “We Are Penn State” still distantly ringing in your ears.\r\n\r\nDespite a disappointing weekend of racing, I shook it off and turned my focus to the future once again: <em>three weeks until Nats</em>. Three weeks of speed refining workouts that would take months of training and transform it into raw speed (or speed raw enough for an 8k). With the culmination of my training so close, even the second Lumberjack lingering on the horizon didn’t scare me. I was raring to go get some great workouts in, but at the same time my poor performance at regionals left me somewhat cautious. After consulting with a past coach, I decided it would be best to forego this week’s interval workout and the race at UVA for a couple longer tempos and a relaxing weekend at home back in Rockville. My reasons for returning home for a weekend extended beyond running. In the preceding two weeks, somewhat due to losing my weekends to meets, schoolwork had begun piling up, alongside a mountain of bureaucratic BS for my EWB project and a fat stack of labs waiting to be graded. I could barely stay awake in class anymore and I could feel my motivation to succeed slipping away. I was going home as a bit of a mental vacation to destress, catch up on some homework, meet up with some old friends at a high school county championship meet, grab some home cooked food, and see my parents for the first time in a while.\r\n\r\nBut as I mentally checked out from my responsibilities that Wednesday, some worrying signs started appearing. The temperature took a quick drop, and as it did people around me began getting sick. I mean <em>really </em>sick. Quarantine kind of sick. Some classmates of mine got hit hard with the flu, but I had gotten vaccinated so I wasn’t particularly worried. Academically, I continued limping through until the end of the week, putting off assignments and meetings until the upcoming week. If I could just make it to the weekend without getting chewed out for missing a deadline, I’d be just fine. That’s what I told myself, and by some miracle it happened. Then, as I returned from my final run in College Park for the week that Friday evening, as I stepped back into my house right behind Mitch and prepared to do a short hip workout in the living room, something peculiar happened.\r\n\r\nMy head began pounding, breathing started to become a bit more difficult, and within 5 minutes I was on the floor of the living room shivering uncontrollably. While I stabilized a bit after a half hour and a warm shower, it was clear that I was coming down with something. While obnoxiously timed, it wasn’t too surprising; Hiro had been sick for the past couple weeks, Christina had come down with an illness a day before, and Jack actually passed out sick on his bed shortly after I returned from my run. Nobody’s safe when it comes to biological warfare. With my head fuzzy and my legs unsteady, I sloppily packed my duffel bag for a short weekend home and awaited the arrival of my parents. When they finally arrived on the way back from my brother’s white coat ceremony in Baltimore, I dropped my bag in the trunk and slumped into the backseat of my mother’s Honda Accord. Through what was likely a rude mumble, I told my parents I was feeling sick, and after catching up for about 10 minutes, I lost any strength I had left to socialize and proceeded to pass out as we slogged through beltway traffic.\r\n\r\nBack in Rockville, feeling a bit stronger, I stumbled into my old house, parked myself on the living room couch, watched a recording of a recent Celtics game with my dad, geeked out over the new Smash Bros announcement with my brother, and went to bed early in the guest room that used to be mine. Consciousness sliding away, I pulled up my phone to let Ryun know that I most likely wouldn’t be up for the tempo we planned for Saturday morning, but that I would probably still see him at the county championship as a spectator. Missing one workout wouldn’t derail my training significantly and attempting a tempo in this state would simply be unproductive. Might as well soak up some recovery over the weekend right?\r\n\r\nI soon found out that no recovery would be occurring this weekend. I woke up at 3AM, somehow simultaneously shivering and drowning in sweat. I tried to throw my covers off, but I soon realized that the strength I needed to get out of bed simply wasn’t in my body. With significant struggle, I crawled onto the floor, stood up, and snatched my water bottle from my nightstand and drank greedily. By the time I had emptied the bottle, my head had started spinning from standing up too quickly, and I realized that I needed to get to the bathroom. Quick. I barely made it through the pitch-black hallway in time before I had to vomit. A less than ideal Friday night, but there have certainly been worse ones.\r\n\r\nMy night did not improve after that, as I quickly became trapped in two-hour cycles of falling asleep shivering, waking up sweating, going back to the bathroom to splash water on my face, and then returning to bed only to dream/hallucinate about being dissected by aliens that all looked vaguely like past cross-country coaches. I slept well past 11AM but did not feel rested at all. My throat pulsed with agony whenever I spoke or coughed, my head spun when I stood up, and somehow the entire world was simultaneously too damn hot and too damn cold. After a warm breakfast and some tall glasses of OJ though, it all seemed to subside. I could walk fine and my fever even dropped a bit. My mom shot me a concerned look when I told her that I still planned to go to counties (which had been delayed due to rain), but I assured her that I wouldn’t be there long and that I’d come right back as soon as I started feeling sick. Within 10 minutes, I was on the road to Briggs’s alma mater to fulfill some promises to some old friends.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of watching my high school team get <em>wrecked</em> and avoiding handshakes for fear of infecting the rest of the general population, I returned to my house a bit fatigued, but not feeling any severe symptoms. I concluded that the worst was over, that I had sweat out most of the fever already and that I’d be right as rain come Monday morning. I even managed to catch up on some grading that night before my tiredness got the best of me and I passed out on the couch. About an hour later I returned to my guest bed with a full bottle of water and an extra heavy blanket, ready to finish off this sickness with a hefty ten hours of sleep so I could get back to business on Monday. I had a training schedule to keep, after all\r\n\r\nNo such thing occurred. Friday night was a warmup, and Saturday night was the main event. I could barely scrape two consecutive hours of sleep before I had to switch blankets to get rid of the one that was slick with sweat. Nightmares occurred and re-occurred, water bottles were emptied and refilled, clothes were changed, and I soon began to wonder whether there was an end in sight. When my dad opened my door at 9AM to check on me, my room was a swirling mass of discarded blankets and clothes with a writhing, shuddering, broken animal at the center. I croaked at my dad that I needed to see a doctor, and he obliged.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that strep throat can be pretty nasty when crossed with a vicious strain of the common cold. My dual illness would continue to trap me in my bed for the rest of the week. Unfortunately, life in the outside world continued, and the world had decided to kick me while I was down, Scott Sterling style. While indisposed, I received two internship rejection emails that essentially wiped out the last of my current prospects, missed two midterms, got screeched at over email for being behind on EWB work, and, perhaps worst of all, found out that Shannon, Mitch, Dan, Anna, Dolf, Lent, and Jacob had all begun experiencing similar symptoms. After a week in bed, two doctor’s visits, a round of antibiotics, a couple half portions of chicken noodle soup, a thoughtful visit from a recovered Christina, and a full season of <em>Attack on Titan</em>, my body had finally recovered, but the universe in which I previously existed had shifted completely while I was gone, and I was not prepared to go back to it.\r\n\r\nBut I could’ve forgiven all the knocks I received in that week if it wasn’t for a discovery I made on Sunday afternoon. For the first time in eight days, with nationals a mere six days in my future, I laced up my running shoes and took a jog around my neighborhood. The leaves in my neighborhood that were green when I had last looked at them had morphed into brilliant colors. At first, I was stunned at how Fall had come instantaneously, but I remember I hadn’t stepped outside in seven days for anything other than a short drive to the doctor’s office. Glad to be outside again, I allowed myself a small bit of optimism. However, once I began jogging up my street, the truth settled in. Like it usually did, my running2win entry encapsulated my feelings perfectly: “2.8 Miles in 20:49 [7:26 per mile]. oh dear god I forgot how running works. 8 days of sickness. fuck.”\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">The Deepest Valley</h4>\r\nAfter some last-minute packing, I piled my things into my father’s RAV4, an old stick-shift that always smelled faintly of cigarette ash. Daylight savings time had kicked in a day before, so it was already pitch-black out at 7PM. As we pulled onto I-270 with The Eagles playing out of the Bluetooth radio, my father cheerfully asked me how it felt to finally return to school. In hindsight, it was funny how disconnected our mindsets were. We had probably spent more time together in the past week than we had in months, but I suppose we hadn’t communicated a lot beyond me asking for a glass of water or for help walking to the shower.\r\n\r\nHow did I feel about returning to school? About facing up to a mountain of responsibilities I had ignored for a week? About starting a long and demeaning internship search over again? About begging professors to let me retake midterms that I wasn’t prepared for in the first place? About running a race, a <em>championship race</em> that I spent six months preparing for, as a shadow of the athlete I was just two weeks ago? I told my father exactly how I felt. I told him I was frustrated. Furious. Miserable. Scared. I asked him how I could be expected to do any of this. How could I can continue to devote my time and effort to these pursuits that mean so much to me if all that progress could be deleted in a week by a couple of microbes? I told him that I was at the lowest point that I had been in a very long time, and the worst part was I had no idea how I was going to claw my way out. Everything I had spent the last six months building was crumbling, and it seemed like I wasn’t going to be far behind.\r\n\r\nMy father listened as he piloted us past beltway exits. A generally easygoing man for a first-generation immigrant, my father responded to me in the way only someone whose life experience infinitely eclipses your own could. Without skipping a beat, he told me that he was surprised that I was even having these thoughts. He thought that, after all the adversity I’d faced as an athlete, after all the work I’d done as a student from an overly competitive high school, after all the stories I’ve heard about how difficult his life was in the Philippines, that I would’ve grown up and accepted some things about the world. “The world doesn’t owe you <em>anything</em>. Any work that you do might earn you a <em>chance</em> at what you want, but you’re not guaranteed jack shit. And it sucks. It’s hard. But that’s the world you live in son.”\r\n\r\nAs you can expect, I had absolutely nothing to respond with. I didn’t know what I wanted or needed during that car ride, whether it was empathy or sympathy, or some acknowledgement of how unfair my situation was, but I was sure as <em>hell</em> that it wasn’t a lecture about how I was being entitled. We spent the remaining 15 minutes of the trip in complete silence, aside from my “Parents” playlist cycling through the Rolling Stones and the two Tom Petty songs that my dad knows. Soon, we pulled into my driveway and my dad helped me move some groceries and fresh laundry back into my house, again without any conversation (and even more oddly without seeing any of my eight roommates). With my possessions all squared-away, I walked out the garage door to thank my dad for driving me back. I began to mouth the first word of some half-assed goodbye when the conversation was taken away from me. The wind had picked up a bit, but I could make out every syllable as my dad hugged me in the middle of the driveway and breathed two sentences in my ear:\r\n\r\n“I believe in you son. Not because you’re my son, but because you can do it.”\r\n\r\nSomething in my chest broke. In 30 seconds, my father was gone and I was back in my bedroom, sitting in the middle of my floor, sobbing. For a while, I couldn’t pin down a specific reason for it. There was a lot in it at once: fear, mental fatigue, loss, disappointment, but at the same time, there was relief in there as well. I don’t think of myself as overly emotional, and I also like to think I’m pretty independent, that I don’t rely a lot on other people. But this felt different. Maybe it was just the sincerity in the words, or that they came from my dad<em>,</em> but when I think back on it hard enough, I think the reason was that, for a while before he said that he believed in me, it didn’t feel like anyone did.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Belief</h4>\r\nBrian, who I now suspect is an omniscient being from another dimension, once told me that, no matter how the weather at your high school regional meet, whether it was 70 or 40 degrees, it would always be sub-freezing at your state championship a week later, which is probably the most accurate thing I’ve ever heard. Nationals in Kentucky, which I found out is not actually in the deep south like I thought, was no exception to the trend. After some eccentric upperclassmen races and a long bathroom wait that forced me to run a solo warmup to the woods and back (truly dark times), I stood on the start line, moments before the gun with one thought; “Mittens or no mittens?”\r\n\r\nRyun’s final pre-race speech wasn’t met with overzealous screaming today like it usually was. The jokes about turtles or other teams weren’t there today, and Ryun kept his voice level and steady as he delivered his 2 minutes of inspiration. He talked about being a senior, about how much work we had put in together, and about the obstacles we had hit. It was true; four of the seven guys on that line had spent at least half a week with the plague in the past two weeks. We we’re about to fight quite an uphill battle. But Ryun passionately disregarded all of it. “Today isn’t about the physical stuff. That was done weeks ago. Today is about that logo on your jersey. Today is about how much that logo on your chest means to you, and whether or not it means more to you than some other guy’s logo means to him.”\r\n\r\nDespite the speech, I had no illusions about my capabilities. I spent the week prior struggling to complete five-mile easy runs. It had been almost three weeks since I had run a mile in under six minutes. Beyond that, I was 90% sure I was still sick. But just because I didn’t believe that I would PR, or earn an All-American certificate, or even score for my team, didn’t mean that I didn’t believe <em>in</em> anything. I believed in Ryun’s message. I believed that no matter the race results, that the white ‘M’ emblazoned on my chest meant more than another letter of the damn alphabet on anyone else’s crusty ass singlet. I didn’t need a trophy or a medal to know that I ran for the best team on that starting line, and that was enough.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, we were all out there together amidst a toiling sea of athletes, jostling each other around as they struggled to fight through the frozen mud. Already straining to breathe, I rounded a curve to watch the leaders hit the mile mark about 30 seconds ahead of me. Feelings of indignance crept into my mind; a couple twists of fate in the opposite direction and I would’ve been chasing them, not stuck in the back with a dude racing in sunglasses and another guy in a T-shirt. But I silenced those thoughts. I didn’t live in that world anymore, and I was going to focus on what I could control. With each progressive mile I fought new competitors as the race ebbed and flowed. I lost some battles and I won some, worked a couple uphills just right and botched some others. My body my have faltered many times in those five miles, five miles that I had run around a thousand to train for, but one thing never changed out on that course. At every turn I made and every hill I crested, through the thunderous tunnel of sound that surrounds runners on a crowded course, I heard my teammates cheers piercing through the noise. They were out there with me, when they could’ve been preparing for their own races or relaxing in a heated car. If there was any doubt about it before, it was completely gone now; my dad wasn’t the only one who believed in me.\r\n\r\nMy finish, once again, was unceremonious and lacking in terms of personal achievement. Just like Kehoe six months before, I finished another season not with a bang, but with a pop scarcely louder than the faulty starting pistol at Nationals. But this time that blow didn’t have the same sting to it. Sure, I hadn’t reached the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the season, and it would be a long time until I had another shot. A younger me would’ve been worried about ever being able to make a real run at those goals ever again, worried about what my short future as a college athlete held, but as I staggered back to the tent shivering for warmth under a sheet of aluminum foil, I was enveloped by a symphony of hopeful sounds. Jokes and heartfelt congratulations were exchanged. Those who raced shared advice with those who hadn’t, and successful runners modestly deflected praise. Plans for cheering on the remaining runners were concocted and wishes of good luck were sent towards the girls’ team as they departed for a warmup.\r\n\r\nA younger me would’ve been worried, but after all I had gone through with this community, after the endless workouts we dragged each other through and the brutal obstacles we helped each other overcome and the failures we rebounded from together, I knew I had nothing to worry about. I was not alone. I was no longer cold. Thanks to every single person on this club, our tomorrow looks bright, and I truly believe in that.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Tomorrow</h4>\r\nI may not have achieved exactly what I set out to do this semester. In May, my goals fit into the framework of any generic, computer-generated cross-country runner: An All-American finish, a podium finish for the team, and a shiny low 25-minute PR. Good place, good team finish, good time. More generic than a cornfield in Ohio. What I’ve found instead, is that I achieved a lot of what I <em>didn’t </em>set out to do this semester. I’ve connected with so many new people, and found some friendships with people who have been around for a while who I’ve just never clicked with until now. I’ve failed, and recovered from those failures, and in the process become a more resilient person and learned more than a fast time could have ever taught me.\r\n\r\nThis is what I believe is so special about our club. We attract so many people with such diverse backgrounds and goals, and when these people all start to interact, they start to resonate and react to each other and, in many scenarios, people end up getting way more out of the community than they expected when they first approached it. We are all constantly changing and being shaped by the people around us, and I am grateful that I get to surround myself with people who are constantly trying to better themselves, both as athletes and people.\r\n\r\nAs the semester winds down and we look to the future, I’m certain that I’m going to look at this season as a special one, and I plan to enter next semester with a newfound determination. Not only determination to exact my revenge on Penn State for permanently damaging my hearing with their dumb chant, but determination to be the best version of myself. The best part of this team is that I know that I am not alone in that. I hope you all took as much from this season as I did and are looking forward to sticking around for the Spring and beyond, because I believe we’ve got a special group of people here, and it’s truly the people, <em>all </em>the people, that make UMD Club Running the wonderful phenomenon it is.', 'A Reflection', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-reflection', '', '', '2018-11-18 12:09:22', '2018-11-18 17:09:22', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=292', 0, 'post', '', 2);

(293, 33, '2018-11-17 23:51:32', '2018-11-18 04:51:32', '<h2>By Colin SyBing</h2>\r\nDear UMD Club Running,\r\n\r\nAs I write this, it’s almost midnight on Sunday November 11<sup>th </sup>(though it’ll probably be much longer before I finish). More specifically, I’ve just emerged from a post-Nationals car ride coma, checked the grade I received on the midterm I took right before leaving last week (eh), commented on a couple of Andrew Lent’s meme-y photos from the meet, and already begun experiencing NIRCA withdrawal. But, as I reflect on yet another wonderful weekend full of running, inside jokes, and absurdly cold weather, I can’t help but feel a bit emotional and look back at the past half year. If you’ll indulge me, I’d like to look back on the past six months and share my experiences with the team and take a moment to think about the future. That’s right; kick back and choose your favorite assignment to procrastinate on, because it’s gonna be a long blog post. Let’s reminisce.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Anti-Climax</h4>\r\nAs I rounded out the final, ~90-meter straightaway at UMD’s very own Kehoe Track, I glanced at the clock to confirm the suspicion in the back of my mind. For the umpteenth time in my career as a 1500m/mile runner, I had led the race only to been outkicked in the last 200m by some guy with better leg speed and a smarter racing strategy. Despite what Prefontaine might tell you, running boldly doesn’t always pay off when you can’t kick. But that wasn’t what stung the most. What stung, deep within my throbbing chest as a slight drizzle began to fall down on the track that Friday night in May, was that ever since a thrilling 4:01 PR a month prior, I had failed to reach my season goal of breaking 4 minutes in the 1500m, a goal I held ever since entering college.\r\n\r\nI puked up the 251 dinner I had 3 hours prior into a nearby trashcan as my father came on to the field to congratulate me on my fantastic 5k race (my father, to this day, doesn’t know how long a track is). Regretfully, I looked up at the varsity athletes setting up to run the fast heat of the 1500m, the cut for which I unfortunately did not make. I couldn’t help but feel another pang of disappointment as I realized that my season had just ended, and ended in such an unceremonious fashion. No more interval workouts, no more lacing up spikes, no more laughing at kids with horrible form with Jacob from the stands. Yet another year of running completed, and yet I was still left without that sense of climactic achievement: the bursting sensation of finally smashing that goal that you’ve been working towards for months. Nothing. Zip. No ceremony, no inner satisfaction, no victorious spirit left for some club kid that got outkicked in the slow heat at a varsity meet.\r\n\r\nI shuffled through a short, rainy cooldown jog as I prepared to cheer on my teammates for the 5k. As I awaited the starting gun for the final event of the night, I began mentally mapping out the next couple months. “Build up your mileage, stay consistent, get the strength training in, hit the midsummer tempos, and then you guys will have your shot at a great nationals finish.” It was all so simple. Nothing could possibly go wrong. My planning was cut short as I was tasked with shrieking at my teammates in the rain for 12.5 laps around our stupidly proportioned track, but I knew that, despite my disappointment today, my teammates and I had a shot at working on something great, and that alone was enough to lift my spirits: a belief in a better tomorrow.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">The Long Summer Months</h4>\r\nAfter a week of finals preparation, summer goodbyes, and, most notably, no running, it was time for a very special part of the year: summer training. Everything’s hot, everything’s long, and everything’s possible. This year, unlike past years, we had clear goals and an ambitious training plan from everyone’s personal life coach, Jack Wavering. Hit the miles, do the workouts, make the podium at Nats. Simple. Elegant. Genius. Not only did we have an A-1 training plan, but we had some bomb-ass plans to follow it. With a large portion of the boys team still in and around College Park and the move in date for an infamous non-club-associated house just on the horizon, we didn’t just have a training plan, we had a <strong>training team</strong>, a luxury not many college teams possess.\r\n\r\nAnd boy was it a blast. Through three and a half summer months of torturous summer class, a music festival, World Cup matches, trips to the beach, a shitty half-internship that I still haven’t been paid for, counseling at a summer running camp, and a trip to Canada, through heat warnings, 100% humidity, thunderstorms, early mornings and late nights, over concrete, dirt paths, but mostly concrete, I powered (and sometimes trudged) my way through summer miles alongside my teammates, my roommates, and my best friends. New routes were constructed, running playlists were carefully designed, and friendships were strengthened. My team was with me every step of the way as we all strove towards that Nationals podium, with tens of salty core sessions, hundreds of rounds of Contact, and most likely thousands of popsicles.\r\n\r\nAnd from what I saw on the greatest running log site known to man, the 8809 group was not the only one putting in great efforts. At the end of long days in a classroom, I would pull up running2win to read tales of heroes, tales of Katrina waking up before sunrise to run before work, of Elliot pumping up his mileage and quickening his pace during his first year of summer training, of Sarah and Julia driving across Maryland to find a place to run together, of Christina fighting to return from a nasty injury in the spring, of Ryun running multiple times each day at blindingly quick paces, and of Shannon running even faster than Ryun because why the hell not? Each of these teammates, and all the others that unfortunately use Strava like hobby joggers, were all working for the success of the team and for themselves, embodying what I believe to be truly beautiful about our sport. It was these people, the people who were forced into bad situations but fought to reach their goals anyway, who faced great adversity and simply didn’t care, who inspired me when my training was at its toughest, and for that I thank everyone (and running2win).\r\n\r\nEach day, I got faster, leaner, and more confident as I logged the hardest miles I think I’ve ever run in my life. Capping it all off in August with two consecutive 70-mile weeks (my highest mileage weeks ever), I strode into the school year with the utmost confidence in myself and my team, with just shy of 800 summer miles on my legs and legs of my teammates to back it all up. This was it. This was our year. After two years of not living up to the potential of our training due to nagging injuries and generally unfocused goals, we were waltzing into Fall of 2018 with a <strong>goddamn squad</strong>.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">New Beginnings and New Successes</h4>\r\nThe semester started off quick and chaotic like normal. Classes are hard, finding time to run is difficult, apparently you have to start applying for jobs in September, and there’s a whole new crop of names and majors to memorize. Nevertheless, it was clear, at least to me, that this year had a different vibe to it. I felt more focused, more motivated, and generally in higher spirits. My morale was further bolstered by the arrival of a fantastic class of new club members, some with stories that’ll make you laugh hours after you hear them, some with impressive running accolades, and all of them with positive, cheerful, motivated attitudes that I certainly wish I had as a freshman entering a new environment. Everything was lining up perfectly, and everyone around me seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves, something I think we can take for granted when semesters get busy.\r\n\r\nFrom September to mid-October, I felt invincible. It just seemed like everything was going right; my classes were interesting but not too tough, I had a couple internship interviews lined up, and my EWB project was getting off the ground, but to be honest, any joy I took from those paled in comparison to how I felt when I ran with this team. To paraphrase Mitch, “Literally nothing else matters as long as you’re fit.” And he was right. No matter how long a day I had or how sleep-deprived I became, I had trump card for happiness; I was fit and I had a great group of people to run with. Some personal highlights of my semester include (but are not limited to):\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>A 6:30AM 20 x 400m with Mitch followed by a 7AM Lumberjack with Mitch two weeks after</li>\r\n 	<li>Running at 9PM on a Monday with Jack only to be outrun by a guy in jeans who was late for his shift at Blaze</li>\r\n 	<li>Running a mile with Elliot and MT while finishing a freezy-pop on the first day of practice</li>\r\n 	<li>Nearly losing a time trial to some random freshman</li>\r\n 	<li>The Toga Party</li>\r\n 	<li>Finally running a decent race at Paul Short at my 4<sup>th</sup> time at that stupid course\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Hearing about Andrew and Mitchell’s race after that and subsequently crying of laughter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n 	<li>Styling on the IM soccer field during our most successful season yet (long live Yeet City)</li>\r\n 	<li>Following MT on a run of 20+ guys to PG Plaza that somehow turned into Riverdale, because all routes are actually just Riverdale</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">A Glorious Day: Princeton</h4>\r\nWith two races under our belts by mid-October, it seemed as though our third would be spoiled by some unforeseen circumstances. The Princeton Invitational, the historically fastest meet of the year and fastest course on the east coast (unless you’re a girl), had its existence come into question due to “construction” on the course. How you perform construction on a cornfield literally two days after the varsity meet at the same course remains a mystery to me, but I’ll give the meet coordinators the benefit of the doubt on this one. There was talk of rescheduling and cancelling, talk of moving the meet, and talk of going to the *shudders* Georgetown Invite instead. The uncertainty was absolutely maddening.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Princeton’s Running Club, led by a really fast leprechaun, that girl that doesn’t know how to read results, a sentient didgeridoo, and Jacob’s boyfriend, found an alternate course at a park in New Jersey. With bright eyes and high hopes, we set off for New Jersey on an early Sunday morning, and were rewarded with perfect weather, great competition, and, most importantly, the <em>actual </em>fastest course on the east coast. My Lord this park was like cross country heaven, mainly because it was nothing like a cross country course; not a single hill could be seen and 80% of the race was run on a crushed gravel path.\r\n\r\nThe girls raced first, and the results could not have been more encouraging. People were PR’ing left and right, shaving multiple minutes off their fastest times. People were so excited that it seemed as if the air itself was electric. I could hardly contain myself as the girl’s race wrapped up and I began warming up. Today was going to be great, I could feel it. My chest swelled with excitement as I was rudely photographed doing my leg extensions on the start line once again. As always, Ryun graced us with a wonderful pump up speech about turtles and defense and whatnot and we strode back to the line.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the gun went off, I flew out to the front to dodge traffic at the first bottleneck. Despite some later chastising from Ryun, I thought I was off to a dream start. As the first mile wore on, I allowed a group of 10-11 leaders to move up ahead. For someone who usually chases the leaders, an odd calm had settled over me. Maybe it was the hyperventilating guy in sneakers and a T-shirt that sprinted ahead of me to chase the leaders that told me that some of the guys in front of me were likely to drop back eventually. I rolled through the first mile with the leaders still in my sights, not bothering to check a watch or listen for anyone yelling out a split; I knew it was fast. Calmly, I decided to maintain my following distance until the third mile before making any bold moves, and as I made that decision something miraculous happened. Mitch came up on my shoulder, barely breathing. I was already determined to race well, but there’s something about racing next to a teammate that you’ve known for years, matching strides, knowing that you both feel good that makes you think “Let’s. Fucking. <em>Go</em>.”\r\n\r\nMitch and I ran stride for stride for the next 3 miles, watching utter carnage unfold in front of us. The leaders were dropping like flies. One by one, overly ambitious athletes faded from the front pack, only to be surrounded and passed by Mitch and me on either side, never to be seen again. Soon, we hit the grass by the start for the final time, meaning that we had just a bit less than a mile to go. I focused my eyes 30m forward on my next victim: the dubious individual known solely as “Princeton Guy.” At this moment, a sliver of doubt crawled into my mind for the first time. This guy was older and more talented than I was. I watched this guy lead the Mid-Atlantic Regional race one year ago from 50<sup>th</sup> or so place. If I even got close to catching him, he’d most likely just outkick me. Maybe this was it. Maybe my luck had run out. Maybe it was time to settle and cruise to the finish. But as Princeton Guy rounded a turn about 30m ahead of me, he did something that melted any fear out of me.\r\n\r\nHe looked over his shoulder, straight at me. He was scared.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, I became a different runner. My hips were no longer dropped. My stride lengthened ever so slightly but my feet were leaving the ground faster than before. My arms were pumping harder and my eyes were glued squarely on the shoulders of my newest competitor. I was bounding closer, closer, and closer still with every stride. This runner who I had previously classified as completely out of my range, totally above my paygrade, was moving back to me in slow motion. Ten seconds later, he was a thing of the past. I blew by him with a kilometer to go, and soon I put another runner behind me as well right before making a hard right onto the final straightaway.\r\n\r\nEyes focused straight ahead, I saw Ryun’s back in the distance. Ryun, who consistently ran workouts twice as long as I did (and way faster too). Ryun, whose running logs made my eyes pop out of my head. Ryun, the guy who I watched score a bronze medal at track nationals six months prior. That guy was in my sights. Maybe it’s rude to say this about a teammate, but I can tell you honestly that I’ve rarely felt a stronger urge to accelerate than I did in that moment. 600m or so later, and it was all over. I had closed my following distance to a meager 10 meters, and as I leaned over the line, I craned my neck to the left to see the clock.\r\n\r\n<em>Holy shit.</em> 25:30 and change. I didn’t even have time to calculate that as a 70 second PR before my teammates started streaming across the finish line behind me. Mitch flew in right behind me, and then Brian blazed into the chute, followed soon after by a hard-kicking Rylan and Jack, and in that moment I let out what could only be described as a primal scream. This was <em>it</em>. Not only did we have this meet in the bag for the second year in a row, but we did it in triumphant fashion. Scorching fast times aside, we had run together perfectly, and dominated a rival team that had blown us out of the water at Regionals and Nationals last year.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was a blur of congratulations, granola bar fueled sprints (courtesy of the long-missed Matt Patsy), and victorious devouring of free food. The crowd of parents and athletes gathered around a picnic table to read out results, and for the first time in 3 years, I stepped up to receive an award on a cross country podium. More importantly, the girls’ team earned a podium finish and the boys’ team was announced as the returning champs. For me though, more important than any time or place or celebratory rubber duck, was the return of a feeling long-lost. For the first time in a very long while, that bursting swell of accomplishment, that pride, that primal joy of knowing that on this day, I laid everything out on the course and performed at my best, that I truly <em>became</em> the best version of myself, that feeling returned. What I was missing at the Kehoe Invite last May, what I fell short of during cross season last Fall, and what I spent long summer months fighting to reclaim, was finally mine again. And with Regionals a week away, I wanted more.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Obstacles</h4>\r\nRegionals. Oh boy. I had a personal history of completely blowing it on this course. Team-wise, for the past two years, we’ve strode up to Lehigh with the intent of walking away with the trophy. In both my years on this team, we’ve managed to find a brand-new source of swagger right before this weekend, whether it’s a post-Lumberjack pump up speech from Ceruzzi or a strong team performance at Princeton. This year was no different, and the background audio on a certain video on NIRCA’s Instagram from that week will confirm the presence of some cockiness. In past years though, it never worked out. We, specifically the boys’ team, always ended up blowing up or underperforming (aside from some unofficial race results stemming from a course mishap last year).\r\n\r\nFor anyone who can read results, it’s no secret that that trend continued this year. Some things happened out on those Lehigh hills that happened yet this season. People burnt out early, fatigue showed on the legs of many, and the killer instinct necessary to succeed in an 8k was nowhere to be found. The boys and girls each finished 4<sup>th</sup>, and while I would later chalk up this less than stellar performance to the fact that we trained through the meet (as opposed to other teams who may have designed a small peak into their training plan at the expense of a sharper peak at nationals), I couldn’t help but walk away from Lehigh with a sour taste in my mouth, though I suppose it’s hard not to get frustrated with the dystopian echoes of “We Are Penn State” still distantly ringing in your ears.\r\n\r\nDespite a disappointing weekend of racing, I shook it off and turned my focus to the future once again: <em>three weeks until Nats</em>. Three weeks of speed refining workouts that would take months of training and transform it into raw speed (or speed raw enough for an 8k). With the culmination of my training so close, even the second Lumberjack lingering on the horizon didn’t scare me. I was raring to go get some great workouts in, but at the same time my poor performance at regionals left me somewhat cautious. After consulting with a past coach, I decided it would be best to forego this week’s interval workout and the race at UVA for a couple longer tempos and a relaxing weekend at home back in Rockville. My reasons for returning home for a weekend extended beyond running. In the preceding two weeks, somewhat due to losing my weekends to meets, schoolwork had begun piling up, alongside a mountain of bureaucratic BS for my EWB project and a fat stack of labs waiting to be graded. I could barely stay awake in class anymore and I could feel my motivation to succeed slipping away. I was going home as a bit of a mental vacation to destress, catch up on some homework, meet up with some old friends at a high school county championship meet, grab some home cooked food, and see my parents for the first time in a while.\r\n\r\nBut as I mentally checked out from my responsibilities that Wednesday, some worrying signs started appearing. The temperature took a quick drop, and as it did people around me began getting sick. I mean <em>really </em>sick. Quarantine kind of sick. Some classmates of mine got hit hard with the flu, but I had gotten vaccinated so I wasn’t particularly worried. Academically, I continued limping through until the end of the week, putting off assignments and meetings until the upcoming week. If I could just make it to the weekend without getting chewed out for missing a deadline, I’d be just fine. That’s what I told myself, and by some miracle it happened. Then, as I returned from my final run in College Park for the week that Friday evening, as I stepped back into my house right behind Mitch and prepared to do a short hip workout in the living room, something peculiar happened.\r\n\r\nMy head began pounding, breathing started to become a bit more difficult, and within 5 minutes I was on the floor of the living room shivering uncontrollably. While I stabilized a bit after a half hour and a warm shower, it was clear that I was coming down with something. While obnoxiously timed, it wasn’t too surprising; Hiro had been sick for the past couple weeks, Christina had come down with an illness a day before, and Jack actually passed out sick on his bed shortly after I returned from my run. Nobody’s safe when it comes to biological warfare. With my head fuzzy and my legs unsteady, I sloppily packed my duffel bag for a short weekend home and awaited the arrival of my parents. When they finally arrived on the way back from my brother’s white coat ceremony in Baltimore, I dropped my bag in the trunk and slumped into the backseat of my mother’s Honda Accord. Through what was likely a rude mumble, I told my parents I was feeling sick, and after catching up for about 10 minutes, I lost any strength I had left to socialize and proceeded to pass out as we slogged through beltway traffic.\r\n\r\nBack in Rockville, feeling a bit stronger, I stumbled into my old house, parked myself on the living room couch, watched a recording of a recent Celtics game with my dad, geeked out over the new Smash Bros announcement with my brother, and went to bed early in the guest room that used to be mine. Consciousness sliding away, I pulled up my phone to let Ryun know that I most likely wouldn’t be up for the tempo we planned for Saturday morning, but that I would probably still see him at the county championship as a spectator. Missing one workout wouldn’t derail my training significantly and attempting a tempo in this state would simply be unproductive. Might as well soak up some recovery over the weekend right?\r\n\r\nI soon found out that no recovery would be occurring this weekend. I woke up at 3AM, somehow simultaneously shivering and drowning in sweat. I tried to throw my covers off, but I soon realized that the strength I needed to get out of bed simply wasn’t in my body. With significant struggle, I crawled onto the floor, stood up, and snatched my water bottle from my nightstand and drank greedily. By the time I had emptied the bottle, my head had started spinning from standing up too quickly, and I realized that I needed to get to the bathroom. Quick. I barely made it through the pitch-black hallway in time before I had to vomit. A less than ideal Friday night, but there have certainly been worse ones.\r\n\r\nMy night did not improve after that, as I quickly became trapped in two-hour cycles of falling asleep shivering, waking up sweating, going back to the bathroom to splash water on my face, and then returning to bed only to dream/hallucinate about being dissected by aliens that all looked vaguely like past cross-country coaches. I slept well past 11AM but did not feel rested at all. My throat pulsed with agony whenever I spoke or coughed, my head spun when I stood up, and somehow the entire world was simultaneously too damn hot and too damn cold. After a warm breakfast and some tall glasses of OJ though, it all seemed to subside. I could walk fine and my fever even dropped a bit. My mom shot me a concerned look when I told her that I still planned to go to counties (which had been delayed due to rain), but I assured her that I wouldn’t be there long and that I’d come right back as soon as I started feeling sick. Within 10 minutes, I was on the road to Briggs’s alma mater to fulfill some promises to some old friends.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of watching my high school team get <em>wrecked</em> and avoiding handshakes for fear of infecting the rest of the general population, I returned to my house a bit fatigued, but not feeling any severe symptoms. I concluded that the worst was over, that I had sweat out most of the fever already and that I’d be right as rain come Monday morning. I even managed to catch up on some grading that night before my tiredness got the best of me and I passed out on the couch. About an hour later I returned to my guest bed with a full bottle of water and an extra heavy blanket, ready to finish off this sickness with a hefty ten hours of sleep so I could get back to business on Monday. I had a training schedule to keep, after all\r\n\r\nNo such thing occurred. Friday night was a warmup, and Saturday night was the main event. I could barely scrape two consecutive hours of sleep before I had to switch blankets to get rid of the one that was slick with sweat. Nightmares occurred and re-occurred, water bottles were emptied and refilled, clothes were changed, and I soon began to wonder whether there was an end in sight. When my dad opened my door at 9AM to check on me, my room was a swirling mass of discarded blankets and clothes with a writhing, shuddering, broken animal at the center. I croaked at my dad that I needed to see a doctor, and he obliged.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that strep throat can be pretty nasty when crossed with a vicious strain of the common cold. My dual illness would continue to trap me in my bed for the rest of the week. Unfortunately, life in the outside world continued, and the world had decided to kick me while I was down, Scott Sterling style. While indisposed, I received two internship rejection emails that essentially wiped out the last of my current prospects, missed two midterms, got screeched at over email for being behind on EWB work, and, perhaps worst of all, found out that Shannon, Mitch, Dan, Anna, Dolf, Lent, and Jacob had all begun experiencing similar symptoms. After a week in bed, two doctor’s visits, a round of antibiotics, a couple half portions of chicken noodle soup, a thoughtful visit from a recovered Christina, and a full season of <em>Attack on Titan</em>, my body had finally recovered, but the universe in which I previously existed had shifted completely while I was gone, and I was not prepared to go back to it.\r\n\r\nBut I could’ve forgiven all the knocks I received in that week if it wasn’t for a discovery I made on Sunday afternoon. For the first time in eight days, with nationals a mere six days in my future, I laced up my running shoes and took a jog around my neighborhood. The leaves in my neighborhood that were green when I had last looked at them had morphed into brilliant colors. At first, I was stunned at how Fall had come instantaneously, but I remember I hadn’t stepped outside in seven days for anything other than a short drive to the doctor’s office. Glad to be outside again, I allowed myself a small bit of optimism. However, once I began jogging up my street, the truth settled in. Like it usually did, my running2win entry encapsulated my feelings perfectly: “2.8 Miles in 20:49 [7:26 per mile]. oh dear god I forgot how running works. 8 days of sickness. fuck.”\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">The Deepest Valley</h4>\r\nAfter some last-minute packing, I piled my things into my father’s RAV4, an old stick-shift that always smelled faintly of cigarette ash. Daylight savings time had kicked in a day before, so it was already pitch-black out at 7PM. As we pulled onto I-270 with The Eagles playing out of the Bluetooth radio, my father cheerfully asked me how it felt to finally return to school. In hindsight, it was funny how disconnected our mindsets were. We had probably spent more time together in the past week than we had in months, but I suppose we hadn’t communicated a lot beyond me asking for a glass of water or for help walking to the shower.\r\n\r\nHow did I feel about returning to school? About facing up to a mountain of responsibilities I had ignored for a week? About starting a long and demeaning internship search over again? About begging professors to let me retake midterms that I wasn’t prepared for in the first place? About running a race, a <em>championship race</em> that I spent six months preparing for, as a shadow of the athlete I was just two weeks ago? I told my father exactly how I felt. I told him I was frustrated. Furious. Miserable. Scared. I asked him how I could be expected to do any of this. How could I can continue to devote my time and effort to these pursuits that mean so much to me if all that progress could be deleted in a week by a couple of microbes? I told him that I was at the lowest point that I had been in a very long time, and the worst part was I had no idea how I was going to claw my way out. Everything I had spent the last six months building was crumbling, and it seemed like I wasn’t going to be far behind.\r\n\r\nMy father listened as he piloted us past beltway exits. A generally easygoing man for a first-generation immigrant, my father responded to me in the way only someone whose life experience infinitely eclipses your own could. Without skipping a beat, he told me that he was surprised that I was even having these thoughts. He thought that, after all the adversity I’d faced as an athlete, after all the work I’d done as a student from an overly competitive high school, after all the stories I’ve heard about how difficult his life was in the Philippines, that I would’ve grown up and accepted some things about the world. “The world doesn’t owe you <em>anything</em>. Any work that you do might earn you a <em>chance</em> at what you want, but you’re not guaranteed jack shit. And it sucks. It’s hard. But that’s the world you live in son.”\r\n\r\nAs you can expect, I had absolutely nothing to respond with. I didn’t know what I wanted or needed during that car ride, whether it was empathy or sympathy, or some acknowledgement of how unfair my situation was, but I was sure as <em>hell</em> that it wasn’t a lecture about how I was being entitled. We spent the remaining 15 minutes of the trip in complete silence, aside from my “Parents” playlist cycling through the Rolling Stones and the two Tom Petty songs that my dad knows. Soon, we pulled into my driveway and my dad helped me move some groceries and fresh laundry back into my house, again without any conversation (and even more oddly without seeing any of my eight roommates). With my possessions all squared-away, I walked out the garage door to thank my dad for driving me back. I began to mouth the first word of some half-assed goodbye when the conversation was taken away from me. The wind had picked up a bit, but I could make out every syllable as my dad hugged me in the middle of driveway and breathed two sentences in my ear:\r\n\r\n“I believe in you son. Not because you’re my son, but because you can do it.”\r\n\r\nSomething in my chest broke. In 30 seconds, my father was gone and I was back in my bedroom, sitting in the middle of my floor, sobbing. For a while, I couldn’t pin down a specific reason for it. There was a lot in it at once: fear, mental fatigue, loss, disappointment, but at the same time, there was relief in there as well. I don’t think of myself as overly emotional, and I also like to think I’m pretty independent, that I don’t rely a lot on other people. But this felt different. Maybe it was just the sincerity in the words, or that they came from my dad<em>,</em> but when I think back on it hard enough, I think the reason was that, for a while before he said that he believed in me, it didn’t feel like anyone did.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Belief</h4>\r\nBrian, who I now suspect is an omniscient being from another dimension, once told me that, no matter how the weather at your high school regional meet, whether it was 70 or 40 degrees, it would always be sub-freezing at your state championship a week later, which is probably the most accurate thing I’ve ever heard. Nationals in Kentucky, which I found out is not actually in the deep south like I thought, was no exception to the trend. After some eccentric upperclassmen races and a long bathroom wait that forced me to run a solo warmup to the woods and back (truly dark times), I stood on the start line, moments before the gun with one thought; “Mittens or no mittens?”\r\n\r\nRyun’s final pre-race speech wasn’t met with overzealous screaming today like it usually was. The jokes about turtles or other teams weren’t there today, and Ryun kept his voice level and steady as he delivered his 2 minutes of inspiration. He talked about being a senior, about how much work we had put in together, and about the obstacles we had hit. It was true; four of the seven guys on that line had spent at least half a week with the plague in the past two weeks. We we’re about to fight quite an uphill battle. But Ryun passionately disregarded all of it. “Today isn’t about the physical stuff. That was done weeks ago. Today is about that logo on your jersey. Today is about how much that logo on your chest means to you, and whether or not it means more to you than some other guy’s logo means to him.”\r\n\r\nDespite the speech, I had no illusions about my capabilities. I spent the week prior struggling to complete five-mile easy runs. It had been almost three weeks since I had run a mile in under six minutes. Beyond that, I was 90% sure I was still sick. But just because I didn’t believe that I would PR, or earn an All-American certificate, or even score for my team, didn’t mean that I didn’t believe <em>in</em> anything. I believed in Ryun’s message. I believed that no matter the race results, that the white ‘M’ emblazoned on my chest meant more than another letter of the damn alphabet on anyone else’s crusty ass singlet. I didn’t need a trophy or a medal to know that I ran for the best team on that starting line, and that was enough.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, we were all out there together amidst a toiling sea of athletes, jostling each other around as they struggled to fight through the frozen mud. Already straining to breathe, I rounded a curve to watch the leaders hit the mile mark about 30 seconds ahead of me. Feelings of indignance crept into my mind; a couple twists of fate in the opposite direction and I would’ve been chasing them, not stuck in the back with a dude racing in sunglasses and another guy in a T-shirt. But I silenced those thoughts. I didn’t live in that world anymore, and I was going to focus on what I could control. With each progressive mile I fought new competitors as the race ebbed and flowed. I lost some battles and I won some, worked a couple uphills just right and botched some others. My body my have faltered many times in those five miles, five miles that I had run around a thousand to train for, but one thing never changed out on that course. At every turn I made and every hill I crested, through the thunderous tunnel of sound that surrounds runners on a crowded course, I heard my teammates cheers piercing through the noise. They were out there with me, when they could’ve been preparing for their own races or relaxing in a heated car. If there was any doubt about it before, it was completely gone now; my dad wasn’t the only one who believed in me.\r\n\r\nMy finish, once again, was unceremonious and lacking in terms of personal achievement. Just like Kehoe six months before, I finished another season not with a bang, but with a pop scarcely louder than the faulty starting pistol at Nationals. But this time that blow didn’t have the same sting to it. Sure, I hadn’t reached the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the season, and it would be a long time until I had another shot. A younger me would’ve been worried about ever being able to make a real run at those goals ever again, worried about what my short future as a college athlete held, but as I staggered back to the tent shivering for warmth under a sheet of aluminum foil, I was enveloped by a symphony of hopeful sounds. Jokes and heartfelt congratulations were exchanged. Those who raced shared advice with those who hadn’t, and successful runners modestly deflected praise. Plans for cheering on the remaining runners were concocted and wishes of good luck were sent towards the girls’ team as they departed for a warmup.\r\n\r\nA younger me would’ve been worried, but after all I had gone through with this community, after the endless workouts we dragged each other through and the brutal obstacles we helped each other overcome and the failures we rebounded from together, I knew I had nothing to worry about. I was not alone. I was no longer cold. Thanks to every single person on this club, our tomorrow looks bright, and I truly believe in that.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Tomorrow</h4>\r\nI may not have achieved exactly what I set out to do this semester. In May, my goals fit into the framework of any generic, computer-generated cross-country runner: An All-American finish, a podium finish for the team, and a shiny low 25-minute PR. Good place, good team finish, good time. More generic than a cornfield in Ohio. What I’ve found instead, is that I achieved a lot of what I <em>didn’t </em>set out to do this semester. I’ve connected with so many new people, and found some friendships with people who have been around for a while who I’ve just never clicked with until now. I’ve failed, and recovered from those failures, and in the process become a more resilient person and learned more than a fast time could have ever taught me.\r\n\r\nThis is what I believe is so special about our club. We attract so many people with such diverse backgrounds and goals, and when these people all start to interact, they start to resonate and react to each other and, in many scenarios, people end up getting way more out of the community than they expected when they first approached it. We are all constantly changing and being shaped by the people around us, and I am grateful that I get to surround myself with people who are constantly trying to better themselves, both as athletes and people.\r\n\r\nAs the semester winds down and we look to the future, I’m certain that I’m going to look at this season as a special one, and I plan to enter next semester with a newfound determination. Not only determination to exact my revenge on Penn State for permanently damaging my hearing with their dumb chant, but determination to be the best version of myself. The best part of this team is that I know that I am not alone in that. I hope you all took as much from this season as I did and are looking forward to sticking around for the Spring and beyond, because I believe we’ve got a special group of people here, and it’s truly the people, <em>all </em>the people, that make UMD Club Running the wonderful phenomenon it is.', 'A Reflection', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '292-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-11-17 23:51:32', '2018-11-18 04:51:32', '', 292, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/292-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

(294, 33, '2018-11-18 12:09:22', '2018-11-18 17:09:22', '<h2>By Colin SyBing</h2>\r\nDear UMD Club Running,\r\n\r\nAs I write this, it’s almost midnight on Sunday November 11<sup>th </sup>(though it’ll probably be much longer before I finish). More specifically, I’ve just emerged from a post-Nationals car ride coma, checked the grade I received on the midterm I took right before leaving last week (eh), commented on a couple of Andrew Lent’s meme-y photos from the meet, and already begun experiencing NIRCA withdrawal. But, as I reflect on yet another wonderful weekend full of running, inside jokes, and absurdly cold weather, I can’t help but feel a bit emotional and look back at the past half year. If you’ll indulge me, I’d like to look back on the past six months and share my experiences with the team and take a moment to think about the future. That’s right; kick back and choose your favorite assignment to procrastinate on, because it’s gonna be a long blog post. Let’s reminisce.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Anti-Climax</h4>\r\nAs I rounded out the final, ~90-meter straightaway at UMD’s very own Kehoe Track, I glanced at the clock to confirm the suspicion in the back of my mind. For the umpteenth time in my career as a 1500m/mile runner, I had led the race only to been outkicked in the last 200m by some guy with better leg speed and a smarter racing strategy. Despite what Prefontaine might tell you, running boldly doesn’t always pay off when you can’t kick. But that wasn’t what stung the most. What stung, deep within my throbbing chest as a slight drizzle began to fall down on the track that Friday night in May, was that ever since a thrilling 4:01 PR a month prior, I had failed to reach my season goal of breaking 4 minutes in the 1500m, a goal I held ever since entering college.\r\n\r\nI puked up the 251 dinner I had 3 hours prior into a nearby trashcan as my father came on to the field to congratulate me on my fantastic 5k race (my father, to this day, doesn’t know how long a track is). Regretfully, I looked up at the varsity athletes setting up to run the fast heat of the 1500m, the cut for which I unfortunately did not make. I couldn’t help but feel another pang of disappointment as I realized that my season had just ended, and ended in such an unceremonious fashion. No more interval workouts, no more lacing up spikes, no more laughing at kids with horrible form with Jacob from the stands. Yet another year of running completed, and yet I was still left without that sense of climactic achievement: the bursting sensation of finally smashing that goal that you’ve been working towards for months. Nothing. Zip. No ceremony, no inner satisfaction, no victorious spirit left for some club kid that got outkicked in the slow heat at a varsity meet.\r\n\r\nI shuffled through a short, rainy cooldown jog as I prepared to cheer on my teammates for the 5k. As I awaited the starting gun for the final event of the night, I began mentally mapping out the next couple months. “Build up your mileage, stay consistent, get the strength training in, hit the midsummer tempos, and then you guys will have your shot at a great nationals finish.” It was all so simple. Nothing could possibly go wrong. My planning was cut short as I was tasked with shrieking at my teammates in the rain for 12.5 laps around our stupidly proportioned track, but I knew that, despite my disappointment today, my teammates and I had a shot at working on something great, and that alone was enough to lift my spirits: a belief in a better tomorrow.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">The Long Summer Months</h4>\r\nAfter a week of finals preparation, summer goodbyes, and, most notably, no running, it was time for a very special part of the year: summer training. Everything’s hot, everything’s long, and everything’s possible. This year, unlike past years, we had clear goals and an ambitious training plan from everyone’s personal life coach, Jack Wavering. Hit the miles, do the workouts, make the podium at Nats. Simple. Elegant. Genius. Not only did we have an A-1 training plan, but we had some bomb-ass plans to follow it. With a large portion of the boys team still in and around College Park and the move in date for an infamous non-club-associated house just on the horizon, we didn’t just have a training plan, we had a <strong>training team</strong>, a luxury not many college teams possess.\r\n\r\nAnd boy was it a blast. Through three and a half summer months of torturous summer class, a music festival, World Cup matches, trips to the beach, a shitty half-internship that I still haven’t been paid for, counseling at a summer running camp, and a trip to Canada, through heat warnings, 100% humidity, thunderstorms, early mornings and late nights, over concrete, dirt paths, but mostly concrete, I powered (and sometimes trudged) my way through summer miles alongside my teammates, my roommates, and my best friends. New routes were constructed, running playlists were carefully designed, and friendships were strengthened. My team was with me every step of the way as we all strove towards that Nationals podium, with tens of salty core sessions, hundreds of rounds of Contact, and most likely thousands of popsicles.\r\n\r\nAnd from what I saw on the greatest running log site known to man, the 8809 group was not the only one putting in great efforts. At the end of long days in a classroom, I would pull up running2win to read tales of heroes, tales of Katrina waking up before sunrise to run before work, of Elliot pumping up his mileage and quickening his pace during his first year of summer training, of Sarah and Julia driving across Maryland to find a place to run together, of Christina fighting to return from a nasty injury in the spring, of Ryun running multiple times each day at blindingly quick paces, and of Shannon running even faster than Ryun because why the hell not? Each of these teammates, and all the others that unfortunately use Strava like hobby joggers, were all working for the success of the team and for themselves, embodying what I believe to be truly beautiful about our sport. It was these people, the people who were forced into bad situations but fought to reach their goals anyway, who faced great adversity and simply didn’t care, who inspired me when my training was at its toughest, and for that I thank everyone (and running2win).\r\n\r\nEach day, I got faster, leaner, and more confident as I logged the hardest miles I think I’ve ever run in my life. Capping it all off in August with two consecutive 70-mile weeks (my highest mileage weeks ever), I strode into the school year with the utmost confidence in myself and my team, with just shy of 800 summer miles on my legs and legs of my teammates to back it all up. This was it. This was our year. After two years of not living up to the potential of our training due to nagging injuries and generally unfocused goals, we were waltzing into Fall of 2018 with a <strong>goddamn squad</strong>.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">New Beginnings and New Successes</h4>\r\nThe semester started off quick and chaotic like normal. Classes are hard, finding time to run is difficult, apparently you have to start applying for jobs in September, and there’s a whole new crop of names and majors to memorize. Nevertheless, it was clear, at least to me, that this year had a different vibe to it. I felt more focused, more motivated, and generally in higher spirits. My morale was further bolstered by the arrival of a fantastic class of new club members, some with stories that’ll make you laugh hours after you hear them, some with impressive running accolades, and all of them with positive, cheerful, motivated attitudes that I certainly wish I had as a freshman entering a new environment. Everything was lining up perfectly, and everyone around me seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves, something I think we can take for granted when semesters get busy.\r\n\r\nFrom September to mid-October, I felt invincible. It just seemed like everything was going right; my classes were interesting but not too tough, I had a couple internship interviews lined up, and my EWB project was getting off the ground, but to be honest, any joy I took from those paled in comparison to how I felt when I ran with this team. To paraphrase Mitch, “Literally nothing else matters as long as you’re fit.” And he was right. No matter how long a day I had or how sleep-deprived I became, I had trump card for happiness; I was fit and I had a great group of people to run with. Some personal highlights of my semester include (but are not limited to):\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>A 6:30AM 20 x 400m with Mitch followed by a 7AM Lumberjack with Mitch two weeks after</li>\r\n 	<li>Running at 9PM on a Monday with Jack only to be outrun by a guy in jeans who was late for his shift at Blaze</li>\r\n 	<li>Running a mile with Elliot and MT while finishing a freezy-pop on the first day of practice</li>\r\n 	<li>Nearly losing a time trial to some random freshman</li>\r\n 	<li>The Toga Party</li>\r\n 	<li>Finally running a decent race at Paul Short at my 4<sup>th</sup> time at that stupid course\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Hearing about Andrew and Mitchell’s race after that and subsequently crying of laughter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n 	<li>Styling on the IM soccer field during our most successful season yet (long live Yeet City)</li>\r\n 	<li>Following MT on a run of 20+ guys to PG Plaza that somehow turned into Riverdale, because all routes are actually just Riverdale</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">A Glorious Day: Princeton</h4>\r\nWith two races under our belts by mid-October, it seemed as though our third would be spoiled by some unforeseen circumstances. The Princeton Invitational, the historically fastest meet of the year and fastest course on the east coast (unless you’re a girl), had its existence come into question due to “construction” on the course. How you perform construction on a cornfield literally two days after the varsity meet at the same course remains a mystery to me, but I’ll give the meet coordinators the benefit of the doubt on this one. There was talk of rescheduling and cancelling, talk of moving the meet, and talk of going to the *shudders* Georgetown Invite instead. The uncertainty was absolutely maddening.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Princeton’s Running Club, led by a really fast leprechaun, that girl that doesn’t know how to read results, a sentient didgeridoo, and Jacob’s boyfriend, found an alternate course at a park in New Jersey. With bright eyes and high hopes, we set off for New Jersey on an early Sunday morning, and were rewarded with perfect weather, great competition, and, most importantly, the <em>actual </em>fastest course on the east coast. My Lord this park was like cross country heaven, mainly because it was nothing like a cross country course; not a single hill could be seen and 80% of the race was run on a crushed gravel path.\r\n\r\nThe girls raced first, and the results could not have been more encouraging. People were PR’ing left and right, shaving multiple minutes off their fastest times. People were so excited that it seemed as if the air itself was electric. I could hardly contain myself as the girl’s race wrapped up and I began warming up. Today was going to be great, I could feel it. My chest swelled with excitement as I was rudely photographed doing my leg extensions on the start line once again. As always, Ryun graced us with a wonderful pump up speech about turtles and defense and whatnot and we strode back to the line.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the gun went off, I flew out to the front to dodge traffic at the first bottleneck. Despite some later chastising from Ryun, I thought I was off to a dream start. As the first mile wore on, I allowed a group of 10-11 leaders to move up ahead. For someone who usually chases the leaders, an odd calm had settled over me. Maybe it was the hyperventilating guy in sneakers and a T-shirt that sprinted ahead of me to chase the leaders that told me that some of the guys in front of me were likely to drop back eventually. I rolled through the first mile with the leaders still in my sights, not bothering to check a watch or listen for anyone yelling out a split; I knew it was fast. Calmly, I decided to maintain my following distance until the third mile before making any bold moves, and as I made that decision something miraculous happened. Mitch came up on my shoulder, barely breathing. I was already determined to race well, but there’s something about racing next to a teammate that you’ve known for years, matching strides, knowing that you both feel good that makes you think “Let’s. Fucking. <em>Go</em>.”\r\n\r\nMitch and I ran stride for stride for the next 3 miles, watching utter carnage unfold in front of us. The leaders were dropping like flies. One by one, overly ambitious athletes faded from the front pack, only to be surrounded and passed by Mitch and me on either side, never to be seen again. Soon, we hit the grass by the start for the final time, meaning that we had just a bit less than a mile to go. I focused my eyes 30m forward on my next victim: the dubious individual known solely as “Princeton Guy.” At this moment, a sliver of doubt crawled into my mind for the first time. This guy was older and more talented than I was. I watched this guy lead the Mid-Atlantic Regional race one year ago from 50<sup>th</sup> or so place. If I even got close to catching him, he’d most likely just outkick me. Maybe this was it. Maybe my luck had run out. Maybe it was time to settle and cruise to the finish. But as Princeton Guy rounded a turn about 30m ahead of me, he did something that melted any fear out of me.\r\n\r\nHe looked over his shoulder, straight at me. He was scared.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, I became a different runner. My hips were no longer dropped. My stride lengthened ever so slightly but my feet were leaving the ground faster than before. My arms were pumping harder and my eyes were glued squarely on the shoulders of my newest competitor. I was bounding closer, closer, and closer still with every stride. This runner who I had previously classified as completely out of my range, totally above my paygrade, was moving back to me in slow motion. Ten seconds later, he was a thing of the past. I blew by him with a kilometer to go, and soon I put another runner behind me as well right before making a hard right onto the final straightaway.\r\n\r\nEyes focused straight ahead, I saw Ryun’s back in the distance. Ryun, who consistently ran workouts twice as long as I did (and way faster too). Ryun, whose running logs made my eyes pop out of my head. Ryun, the guy who I watched score a bronze medal at track nationals six months prior. That guy was in my sights. Maybe it’s rude to say this about a teammate, but I can tell you honestly that I’ve rarely felt a stronger urge to accelerate than I did in that moment. 600m or so later, and it was all over. I had closed my following distance to a meager 10 meters, and as I leaned over the line, I craned my neck to the left to see the clock.\r\n\r\n<em>Holy shit.</em> 25:30 and change. I didn’t even have time to calculate that as a 70 second PR before my teammates started streaming across the finish line behind me. Mitch flew in right behind me, and then Brian blazed into the chute, followed soon after by a hard-kicking Rylan and Jack, and in that moment I let out what could only be described as a primal scream. This was <em>it</em>. Not only did we have this meet in the bag for the second year in a row, but we did it in triumphant fashion. Scorching fast times aside, we had run together perfectly, and dominated a rival team that had blown us out of the water at Regionals and Nationals last year.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was a blur of congratulations, granola bar fueled sprints (courtesy of the long-missed Matt Patsy), and victorious devouring of free food. The crowd of parents and athletes gathered around a picnic table to read out results, and for the first time in 3 years, I stepped up to receive an award on a cross country podium. More importantly, the girls’ team earned a podium finish and the boys’ team was announced as the returning champs. For me though, more important than any time or place or celebratory rubber duck, was the return of a feeling long-lost. For the first time in a very long while, that bursting swell of accomplishment, that pride, that primal joy of knowing that on this day, I laid everything out on the course and performed at my best, that I truly <em>became</em> the best version of myself, that feeling returned. What I was missing at the Kehoe Invite last May, what I fell short of during cross season last Fall, and what I spent long summer months fighting to reclaim, was finally mine again. And with Regionals a week away, I wanted more.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Obstacles</h4>\r\nRegionals. Oh boy. I had a personal history of completely blowing it on this course. Team-wise, for the past two years, we’ve strode up to Lehigh with the intent of walking away with the trophy. In both my years on this team, we’ve managed to find a brand-new source of swagger right before this weekend, whether it’s a post-Lumberjack pump up speech from Ceruzzi or a strong team performance at Princeton. This year was no different, and the background audio on a certain video on NIRCA’s Instagram from that week will confirm the presence of some cockiness. In past years though, it never worked out. We, specifically the boys’ team, always ended up blowing up or underperforming (aside from some unofficial race results stemming from a course mishap last year).\r\n\r\nFor anyone who can read results, it’s no secret that that trend continued this year. Some things happened out on those Lehigh hills that happened yet this season. People burnt out early, fatigue showed on the legs of many, and the killer instinct necessary to succeed in an 8k was nowhere to be found. The boys and girls each finished 4<sup>th</sup>, and while I would later chalk up this less than stellar performance to the fact that we trained through the meet (as opposed to other teams who may have designed a small peak into their training plan at the expense of a sharper peak at nationals), I couldn’t help but walk away from Lehigh with a sour taste in my mouth, though I suppose it’s hard not to get frustrated with the dystopian echoes of “We Are Penn State” still distantly ringing in your ears.\r\n\r\nDespite a disappointing weekend of racing, I shook it off and turned my focus to the future once again: <em>three weeks until Nats</em>. Three weeks of speed refining workouts that would take months of training and transform it into raw speed (or speed raw enough for an 8k). With the culmination of my training so close, even the second Lumberjack lingering on the horizon didn’t scare me. I was raring to go get some great workouts in, but at the same time my poor performance at regionals left me somewhat cautious. After consulting with a past coach, I decided it would be best to forego this week’s interval workout and the race at UVA for a couple longer tempos and a relaxing weekend at home back in Rockville. My reasons for returning home for a weekend extended beyond running. In the preceding two weeks, somewhat due to losing my weekends to meets, schoolwork had begun piling up, alongside a mountain of bureaucratic BS for my EWB project and a fat stack of labs waiting to be graded. I could barely stay awake in class anymore and I could feel my motivation to succeed slipping away. I was going home as a bit of a mental vacation to destress, catch up on some homework, meet up with some old friends at a high school county championship meet, grab some home cooked food, and see my parents for the first time in a while.\r\n\r\nBut as I mentally checked out from my responsibilities that Wednesday, some worrying signs started appearing. The temperature took a quick drop, and as it did people around me began getting sick. I mean <em>really </em>sick. Quarantine kind of sick. Some classmates of mine got hit hard with the flu, but I had gotten vaccinated so I wasn’t particularly worried. Academically, I continued limping through until the end of the week, putting off assignments and meetings until the upcoming week. If I could just make it to the weekend without getting chewed out for missing a deadline, I’d be just fine. That’s what I told myself, and by some miracle it happened. Then, as I returned from my final run in College Park for the week that Friday evening, as I stepped back into my house right behind Mitch and prepared to do a short hip workout in the living room, something peculiar happened.\r\n\r\nMy head began pounding, breathing started to become a bit more difficult, and within 5 minutes I was on the floor of the living room shivering uncontrollably. While I stabilized a bit after a half hour and a warm shower, it was clear that I was coming down with something. While obnoxiously timed, it wasn’t too surprising; Hiro had been sick for the past couple weeks, Christina had come down with an illness a day before, and Jack actually passed out sick on his bed shortly after I returned from my run. Nobody’s safe when it comes to biological warfare. With my head fuzzy and my legs unsteady, I sloppily packed my duffel bag for a short weekend home and awaited the arrival of my parents. When they finally arrived on the way back from my brother’s white coat ceremony in Baltimore, I dropped my bag in the trunk and slumped into the backseat of my mother’s Honda Accord. Through what was likely a rude mumble, I told my parents I was feeling sick, and after catching up for about 10 minutes, I lost any strength I had left to socialize and proceeded to pass out as we slogged through beltway traffic.\r\n\r\nBack in Rockville, feeling a bit stronger, I stumbled into my old house, parked myself on the living room couch, watched a recording of a recent Celtics game with my dad, geeked out over the new Smash Bros announcement with my brother, and went to bed early in the guest room that used to be mine. Consciousness sliding away, I pulled up my phone to let Ryun know that I most likely wouldn’t be up for the tempo we planned for Saturday morning, but that I would probably still see him at the county championship as a spectator. Missing one workout wouldn’t derail my training significantly and attempting a tempo in this state would simply be unproductive. Might as well soak up some recovery over the weekend right?\r\n\r\nI soon found out that no recovery would be occurring this weekend. I woke up at 3AM, somehow simultaneously shivering and drowning in sweat. I tried to throw my covers off, but I soon realized that the strength I needed to get out of bed simply wasn’t in my body. With significant struggle, I crawled onto the floor, stood up, and snatched my water bottle from my nightstand and drank greedily. By the time I had emptied the bottle, my head had started spinning from standing up too quickly, and I realized that I needed to get to the bathroom. Quick. I barely made it through the pitch-black hallway in time before I had to vomit. A less than ideal Friday night, but there have certainly been worse ones.\r\n\r\nMy night did not improve after that, as I quickly became trapped in two-hour cycles of falling asleep shivering, waking up sweating, going back to the bathroom to splash water on my face, and then returning to bed only to dream/hallucinate about being dissected by aliens that all looked vaguely like past cross-country coaches. I slept well past 11AM but did not feel rested at all. My throat pulsed with agony whenever I spoke or coughed, my head spun when I stood up, and somehow the entire world was simultaneously too damn hot and too damn cold. After a warm breakfast and some tall glasses of OJ though, it all seemed to subside. I could walk fine and my fever even dropped a bit. My mom shot me a concerned look when I told her that I still planned to go to counties (which had been delayed due to rain), but I assured her that I wouldn’t be there long and that I’d come right back as soon as I started feeling sick. Within 10 minutes, I was on the road to Briggs’s alma mater to fulfill some promises to some old friends.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of watching my high school team get <em>wrecked</em> and avoiding handshakes for fear of infecting the rest of the general population, I returned to my house a bit fatigued, but not feeling any severe symptoms. I concluded that the worst was over, that I had sweat out most of the fever already and that I’d be right as rain come Monday morning. I even managed to catch up on some grading that night before my tiredness got the best of me and I passed out on the couch. About an hour later I returned to my guest bed with a full bottle of water and an extra heavy blanket, ready to finish off this sickness with a hefty ten hours of sleep so I could get back to business on Monday. I had a training schedule to keep, after all\r\n\r\nNo such thing occurred. Friday night was a warmup, and Saturday night was the main event. I could barely scrape two consecutive hours of sleep before I had to switch blankets to get rid of the one that was slick with sweat. Nightmares occurred and re-occurred, water bottles were emptied and refilled, clothes were changed, and I soon began to wonder whether there was an end in sight. When my dad opened my door at 9AM to check on me, my room was a swirling mass of discarded blankets and clothes with a writhing, shuddering, broken animal at the center. I croaked at my dad that I needed to see a doctor, and he obliged.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that strep throat can be pretty nasty when crossed with a vicious strain of the common cold. My dual illness would continue to trap me in my bed for the rest of the week. Unfortunately, life in the outside world continued, and the world had decided to kick me while I was down, Scott Sterling style. While indisposed, I received two internship rejection emails that essentially wiped out the last of my current prospects, missed two midterms, got screeched at over email for being behind on EWB work, and, perhaps worst of all, found out that Shannon, Mitch, Dan, Anna, Dolf, Lent, and Jacob had all begun experiencing similar symptoms. After a week in bed, two doctor’s visits, a round of antibiotics, a couple half portions of chicken noodle soup, a thoughtful visit from a recovered Christina, and a full season of <em>Attack on Titan</em>, my body had finally recovered, but the universe in which I previously existed had shifted completely while I was gone, and I was not prepared to go back to it.\r\n\r\nBut I could’ve forgiven all the knocks I received in that week if it wasn’t for a discovery I made on Sunday afternoon. For the first time in eight days, with nationals a mere six days in my future, I laced up my running shoes and took a jog around my neighborhood. The leaves in my neighborhood that were green when I had last looked at them had morphed into brilliant colors. At first, I was stunned at how Fall had come instantaneously, but I remember I hadn’t stepped outside in seven days for anything other than a short drive to the doctor’s office. Glad to be outside again, I allowed myself a small bit of optimism. However, once I began jogging up my street, the truth settled in. Like it usually did, my running2win entry encapsulated my feelings perfectly: “2.8 Miles in 20:49 [7:26 per mile]. oh dear god I forgot how running works. 8 days of sickness. fuck.”\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">The Deepest Valley</h4>\r\nAfter some last-minute packing, I piled my things into my father’s RAV4, an old stick-shift that always smelled faintly of cigarette ash. Daylight savings time had kicked in a day before, so it was already pitch-black out at 7PM. As we pulled onto I-270 with The Eagles playing out of the Bluetooth radio, my father cheerfully asked me how it felt to finally return to school. In hindsight, it was funny how disconnected our mindsets were. We had probably spent more time together in the past week than we had in months, but I suppose we hadn’t communicated a lot beyond me asking for a glass of water or for help walking to the shower.\r\n\r\nHow did I feel about returning to school? About facing up to a mountain of responsibilities I had ignored for a week? About starting a long and demeaning internship search over again? About begging professors to let me retake midterms that I wasn’t prepared for in the first place? About running a race, a <em>championship race</em> that I spent six months preparing for, as a shadow of the athlete I was just two weeks ago? I told my father exactly how I felt. I told him I was frustrated. Furious. Miserable. Scared. I asked him how I could be expected to do any of this. How could I can continue to devote my time and effort to these pursuits that mean so much to me if all that progress could be deleted in a week by a couple of microbes? I told him that I was at the lowest point that I had been in a very long time, and the worst part was I had no idea how I was going to claw my way out. Everything I had spent the last six months building was crumbling, and it seemed like I wasn’t going to be far behind.\r\n\r\nMy father listened as he piloted us past beltway exits. A generally easygoing man for a first-generation immigrant, my father responded to me in the way only someone whose life experience infinitely eclipses your own could. Without skipping a beat, he told me that he was surprised that I was even having these thoughts. He thought that, after all the adversity I’d faced as an athlete, after all the work I’d done as a student from an overly competitive high school, after all the stories I’ve heard about how difficult his life was in the Philippines, that I would’ve grown up and accepted some things about the world. “The world doesn’t owe you <em>anything</em>. Any work that you do might earn you a <em>chance</em> at what you want, but you’re not guaranteed jack shit. And it sucks. It’s hard. But that’s the world you live in son.”\r\n\r\nAs you can expect, I had absolutely nothing to respond with. I didn’t know what I wanted or needed during that car ride, whether it was empathy or sympathy, or some acknowledgement of how unfair my situation was, but I was sure as <em>hell</em> that it wasn’t a lecture about how I was being entitled. We spent the remaining 15 minutes of the trip in complete silence, aside from my “Parents” playlist cycling through the Rolling Stones and the two Tom Petty songs that my dad knows. Soon, we pulled into my driveway and my dad helped me move some groceries and fresh laundry back into my house, again without any conversation (and even more oddly without seeing any of my eight roommates). With my possessions all squared-away, I walked out the garage door to thank my dad for driving me back. I began to mouth the first word of some half-assed goodbye when the conversation was taken away from me. The wind had picked up a bit, but I could make out every syllable as my dad hugged me in the middle of the driveway and breathed two sentences in my ear:\r\n\r\n“I believe in you son. Not because you’re my son, but because you can do it.”\r\n\r\nSomething in my chest broke. In 30 seconds, my father was gone and I was back in my bedroom, sitting in the middle of my floor, sobbing. For a while, I couldn’t pin down a specific reason for it. There was a lot in it at once: fear, mental fatigue, loss, disappointment, but at the same time, there was relief in there as well. I don’t think of myself as overly emotional, and I also like to think I’m pretty independent, that I don’t rely a lot on other people. But this felt different. Maybe it was just the sincerity in the words, or that they came from my dad<em>,</em> but when I think back on it hard enough, I think the reason was that, for a while before he said that he believed in me, it didn’t feel like anyone did.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Belief</h4>\r\nBrian, who I now suspect is an omniscient being from another dimension, once told me that, no matter how the weather at your high school regional meet, whether it was 70 or 40 degrees, it would always be sub-freezing at your state championship a week later, which is probably the most accurate thing I’ve ever heard. Nationals in Kentucky, which I found out is not actually in the deep south like I thought, was no exception to the trend. After some eccentric upperclassmen races and a long bathroom wait that forced me to run a solo warmup to the woods and back (truly dark times), I stood on the start line, moments before the gun with one thought; “Mittens or no mittens?”\r\n\r\nRyun’s final pre-race speech wasn’t met with overzealous screaming today like it usually was. The jokes about turtles or other teams weren’t there today, and Ryun kept his voice level and steady as he delivered his 2 minutes of inspiration. He talked about being a senior, about how much work we had put in together, and about the obstacles we had hit. It was true; four of the seven guys on that line had spent at least half a week with the plague in the past two weeks. We we’re about to fight quite an uphill battle. But Ryun passionately disregarded all of it. “Today isn’t about the physical stuff. That was done weeks ago. Today is about that logo on your jersey. Today is about how much that logo on your chest means to you, and whether or not it means more to you than some other guy’s logo means to him.”\r\n\r\nDespite the speech, I had no illusions about my capabilities. I spent the week prior struggling to complete five-mile easy runs. It had been almost three weeks since I had run a mile in under six minutes. Beyond that, I was 90% sure I was still sick. But just because I didn’t believe that I would PR, or earn an All-American certificate, or even score for my team, didn’t mean that I didn’t believe <em>in</em> anything. I believed in Ryun’s message. I believed that no matter the race results, that the white ‘M’ emblazoned on my chest meant more than another letter of the damn alphabet on anyone else’s crusty ass singlet. I didn’t need a trophy or a medal to know that I ran for the best team on that starting line, and that was enough.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, we were all out there together amidst a toiling sea of athletes, jostling each other around as they struggled to fight through the frozen mud. Already straining to breathe, I rounded a curve to watch the leaders hit the mile mark about 30 seconds ahead of me. Feelings of indignance crept into my mind; a couple twists of fate in the opposite direction and I would’ve been chasing them, not stuck in the back with a dude racing in sunglasses and another guy in a T-shirt. But I silenced those thoughts. I didn’t live in that world anymore, and I was going to focus on what I could control. With each progressive mile I fought new competitors as the race ebbed and flowed. I lost some battles and I won some, worked a couple uphills just right and botched some others. My body my have faltered many times in those five miles, five miles that I had run around a thousand to train for, but one thing never changed out on that course. At every turn I made and every hill I crested, through the thunderous tunnel of sound that surrounds runners on a crowded course, I heard my teammates cheers piercing through the noise. They were out there with me, when they could’ve been preparing for their own races or relaxing in a heated car. If there was any doubt about it before, it was completely gone now; my dad wasn’t the only one who believed in me.\r\n\r\nMy finish, once again, was unceremonious and lacking in terms of personal achievement. Just like Kehoe six months before, I finished another season not with a bang, but with a pop scarcely louder than the faulty starting pistol at Nationals. But this time that blow didn’t have the same sting to it. Sure, I hadn’t reached the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the season, and it would be a long time until I had another shot. A younger me would’ve been worried about ever being able to make a real run at those goals ever again, worried about what my short future as a college athlete held, but as I staggered back to the tent shivering for warmth under a sheet of aluminum foil, I was enveloped by a symphony of hopeful sounds. Jokes and heartfelt congratulations were exchanged. Those who raced shared advice with those who hadn’t, and successful runners modestly deflected praise. Plans for cheering on the remaining runners were concocted and wishes of good luck were sent towards the girls’ team as they departed for a warmup.\r\n\r\nA younger me would’ve been worried, but after all I had gone through with this community, after the endless workouts we dragged each other through and the brutal obstacles we helped each other overcome and the failures we rebounded from together, I knew I had nothing to worry about. I was not alone. I was no longer cold. Thanks to every single person on this club, our tomorrow looks bright, and I truly believe in that.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Tomorrow</h4>\r\nI may not have achieved exactly what I set out to do this semester. In May, my goals fit into the framework of any generic, computer-generated cross-country runner: An All-American finish, a podium finish for the team, and a shiny low 25-minute PR. Good place, good team finish, good time. More generic than a cornfield in Ohio. What I’ve found instead, is that I achieved a lot of what I <em>didn’t </em>set out to do this semester. I’ve connected with so many new people, and found some friendships with people who have been around for a while who I’ve just never clicked with until now. I’ve failed, and recovered from those failures, and in the process become a more resilient person and learned more than a fast time could have ever taught me.\r\n\r\nThis is what I believe is so special about our club. We attract so many people with such diverse backgrounds and goals, and when these people all start to interact, they start to resonate and react to each other and, in many scenarios, people end up getting way more out of the community than they expected when they first approached it. We are all constantly changing and being shaped by the people around us, and I am grateful that I get to surround myself with people who are constantly trying to better themselves, both as athletes and people.\r\n\r\nAs the semester winds down and we look to the future, I’m certain that I’m going to look at this season as a special one, and I plan to enter next semester with a newfound determination. Not only determination to exact my revenge on Penn State for permanently damaging my hearing with their dumb chant, but determination to be the best version of myself. The best part of this team is that I know that I am not alone in that. I hope you all took as much from this season as I did and are looking forward to sticking around for the Spring and beyond, because I believe we’ve got a special group of people here, and it’s truly the people, <em>all </em>the people, that make UMD Club Running the wonderful phenomenon it is.', 'A Reflection', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '292-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-11-18 12:09:22', '2018-11-18 17:09:22', '', 292, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/292-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Well their rivalries command a certain place in our hearts. From bloody Peloponnesian conflict to good old fashion western shootouts each of these rivalries have been balanced for centuries as if Justice herself has blindly held the scale. What rivalry do we not see among the pantheon of great debates? Oh, that’s right, Running2Win vs. Strava! Usually I take the high road citing my favorite author Samuel Clemens “Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.” But I find in this extreme circumstance I can no longer stand by while an oppressive regime seeks to dilute the sacrosanct weekly email in favor of a Running2Win agenda. Put plainly Strava’s superiority is unmatched by any of its peers. According to a source close to the company “They [Strava] have the best interns!” My source also stated that “They [Strava] have a public facing API that any runner can work with and make their own cool stats.” While I am but a lowly dual degree even I can fathom that a public facing API as presented by Strava vastly out does the complicated and distorted product presented by Running2Win. But maybe you don’t mind! Perhaps you can wade through the disgusting soup that congregates upon your internet explorer browser window. So instead of citing the cold hard facts, as many of my fake news counterparts might do, let me present instead a personal anecdote. Last year as a young and eager Freshman I signed up on Running2Win. I then connected the abomination to my Strava therefore allowing both runs and bike rides to be automatically uploaded. While I will spare the gruesome details I, through no fault of my own, ended up on the leaderboards of Running2Win. Some might claim I was cheating hastily pointing out the suspicious patterns of my mercurial fitness. All I can say is the amount of disgusting and upsetting hate mail I received was downright overwhelming. All 2 messages as well as the forum post about myself were thoroughly disheartening. But fear not for I found solace in a community of Cyclists, Triathletes, Skiers, and Runners on a beautiful platform known as Strava. So where do you fit in? Maybe you’re a perspective member, wily alumni, seasoned vet, auspicious newcomer, or curious parent. Your social status does not matter in so far as I have already provided a universal answer. This is not a question of Coke Vs. Pepsi or Marvel vs. DC the debate over Running2Win vs. Strava is nonexistent. Strava is the answer. And so, I challenge you to ask not what Strava can do for you!

And while I enjoy shitting on the state that gave us Snooki and Kris Kristy just as much as the next guy I feel the need to at least attempt a defense of the state that my roommate lives in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirst need I mention the teams best meet from last XC season was in New Jersey and next to Princeton no less? That’s right the state that you hate also gave our team the XC course that allowed people to smash PRs (including a new club record from Shannon), get called to the podium for the first time and for the men’s team a well deserved victory, which destroyed the now tattered name of Princeton’s running club. But even after our victory was announced the men’s club at Princeton humbly acknowledged their Beta male status and kneeled before our immense superiority, a testament to their hospitality and grace in the face of humiliation. This hospitality lays in stark contrast to how many describe New Jerseyans as a-holes and jerks.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso while we may compare Jersey to waste that pollutes the good name of America I would like to point out that Wawa litters their entire state. This great American franchise is not just where New Jerseyans get 100% of there gas and 80% of there food, instead it would be more accurate to describe it as part of there lifestyle and who can really blame a whole state for falling for a store that serves high quality sandwiches 24/7. On a personal note any store that challenges McDonalds (the only store I’ve maintained a lifetime boycott of) monopoly on the lucrative 2am drunk food market has my full support.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow I’ve saved this for last, because I know that it’s what we all truly hate the most about Jersey: the tolls. Driving through New Jersey is like using your fake at Bentleys. First you have to buy the car/fake then you have to pay for gas/alcohol for the pregame then you have to pay the toll/cover fee and then you have to pay for the overpriced shit inside New Jersey’s gas/drinks at the bar. Now to be truthful when I remembered the tolls I stopped writing this blog post then xed out and was about to hit don’t save with they intention of resining myself to hate New Jersey for the rest of my life, until I remembered one very important thing. It wasn’t New Jersey that built these interstate highways and their annoying tollbooths it was the federal government.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking what the problem with the federal government was and then I remembered something Nate told me a while back “Rhode Island is a completely useless state and should be annexed by Connecticut immediately.” This here is the real problem with America. Small states like Rhode Island get two self righteous senators who think they know what the country needs despite both of them representing only 0.3% of the population.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTherefore as of today the office of treasury is proposing a new state for the finest club east of the Mississippi to shit on. The completely useless, utterly irrelevant, and just insignificant state of Rhode Island. A state founded by a radical outcast of Massachusetts, who didn’t even have the decency to flee for the frontier like every other self respecting outlaw in our nations history.

It will be my goal here today to change their minds.\r\n\r\nRhode Island can be compared to a tumultuous tumor growing to the east of Connecticut. It drains life from my home state with promises of beautiful beaches, but in reality it is nothing more than a disgusting growth. Rhode Islanders are reluctant to inform visitors that their coastline holds the shameful position of 5<sup>th</sup> worst water quality amongst states with beaches. Connecticut stands at a respectable 12<sup>th</sup> out of the 30 states with beaches. These facts reveal that Rhode Island has essentially stolen much of Connecticut’s coastline and polluted it beyond repair.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people are undeterred by the idea of swimming in filth. However, how would those people enjoy risking life, limb, and property on their way to these waste infested waterfronts? Rhode Island is ranked 48th in infrastructure quality when compared to all 50 states. While driving through its precarious roads you will encounter potholes deep enough to be the setting of Jules Verne’s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>. Connecticut sits at an impressive 24<sup>th</sup>.\r\n\r\nConnecticut is clearly more proficient at maintaining its infrastructure and waterways than Rhode Island is. Everyone in both states would be better off if they were to merge. What would the name of this “new” state be? Connecticut. My home state would be investing billions of dollars into a nearly hopeless wasteland. They will not tarnish our name. Puerto Rico could then join the union so we do not have to redesign the flag or lose two senators.\r\n\r\nI am hereby calling for our club to come together and move on from our hate of New Jersey.

(330, 33, '2019-02-16 17:41:35', '2019-02-16 22:41:35', 'Rebounding off a Saturday night of long travel, sketchy pizza places, and a hotel of questionable hygiene, the members of Maryland Club Running discovered quite the shock before resting up for the night. The hotel which they inhabited did indeed offer “breakfast,” but the magic word “complementary” was notably absent from that description. Panicked visions of famine and empty wallets raced through the minds of our team of stalwart protagonists.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our resilient athletes took it upon themselves to rouse themselves a half hour earlier than planned on Sunday morning to forage for sustenance in the surrounding area before the meet began. In the semi-urban wasteland that is State College, PA, hidden food oases such as grocery stores, Dunkin Donuts, and some weird bagel place called “The Crust” revealed themselves, and with full stomachs and focused minds, the group swaggered into the venue with… well, swagger.\r\n\r\nThe races, under the watchful eye of local reporter Ryun Anderson, kicked off with the Distance Medley Relay, a rare yet welcome event. During this event, we witnessed five young athletes make their Maryland Club Running racing debut, as Maddie Mandich, Shannon Young, Konrad Shire, Liam Killea, and Matthew Statsiisduifbvibjrbuirvuxus took center stage and propelled our Men’s A and B teams to top ten finishes and our Women’s team to an 11th place finish. Also notable was a particularly speedy 800m leg from freshman Jake Ayres, who for some reason was not listed on the travel report and was not actually seen at the meet…\r\n\r\nImmediately after, Sprint Chair Paige Munshell began her stellar day with a 7th place finish in the 60mHH. Munshell would later go on to complete an impressive triple, placing 10th in the 60m dash (with a new club record of 8.85) and 8th in the 200m dash. Meanwhile, fellow hurdler Ian Tumulty decided to scratch out of later events in order to focus on the 60mHH and a subsequent trip to Five Guys. Tumulty’s newfound passion and focus for the event enabled him to reach his goal of “not being last in an event of literally 4 guys.” Tumulty placed 3rd and proceeded to spend the rest of the meet graciously capturing his photogenic teammates in pictures that will fortunately, never ever be erased.\r\n\r\nMunshell was not the only athlete to set a new club record last Sunday. Sophomore Noah Chong, in between his engineering homework set, threw 10.85m in the shot put, earning him a 4th place finish, a shiny new club record, and an impressive amount of chalk on his neck.\r\n\r\nExcitement came from the distance side as young talent made, as Cardi B calls them, “money moves,” in the mile. Coming off her strong DMR leg, freshman Shannon Young chased a lead pack for the first half of the race, which allowed her to lock down a 6th place finish, with veteran Julia Heiges coming in quickly behind in 11th. On the men’s side, freshman sensation and manager of all our money, Brian McCullough took it upon himself to challenge Penn State’s Bryan Moon. Bets and wagers flew through the air as Battle of the Brian’s took place on the track, and fans were rewarded with a 4:25 full mile from McCullough, second only to Moon’s 4:23.\r\n\r\nHungry for more action, fans were again presented with a treat in the form of “the most painful mile I have ever witnessed” from Briggs Briggs, who almost perfectly duplicated his earlier performance in the mile leg of the Men’s DMR.\r\n\r\nFan’s and athletes alike took their time to recover, both mentally and physically, during the official’s intermission at 12:30. Slam poetry was delivered by McCullough’s other half, the cruelly crippled power-walker Nate Lieske. Naps were taken, lunches were quickly devoured, and Sour Patch Kids: The Cereal became the topic of many heated debates.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, action picked right back up as Statsdybbsfivobgriegons, the only man to not scratch out of the open 400m, proved that yes, distance runners can go sub 60, or as historians refer to it, “sub-Steens.”\r\n\r\nThe energy provided from this performance carried on into the next event: the dreaded 800m. Apparel Coordinator Simone Evans, ironically without a club uniform, flew off the line boldly and scored a strong 4th place finish in 2:36, but even she agreed that, had she been wearing a uniform singlet, that 1st place would have been a piece of cake. As if to prove that freshman are the only people foolish enough to run this dumpster fire of an event, McCullough and Shire took to the track and recorded some promising beginning of the season performances. Shire negative split his way to a 2:06, while McCullough thundered away from the field with 400m to go to take first place in the 500m dash, only to be savagely passed by 3 other competitors as he barreled through the last 300m to finish in 2:02.\r\n\r\nFresh from foregoing the open 400m, newcomers Killea and Harry Rentzeperis joined veteran Ian Lynch for the 200m dash (who was rebounding from an earlier performance in the 60m dash), where the big boys laid out an impressive spread of 8th (Rentzeperis), 13th (Killea), and 25th (Lynch). While not confirmed, it is speculated that former Sprint Chair Matthew Marcel looked on the 200m with a single tear of pride rolling down his face, his heart warmed by the efforts of the active sprinter core. Either that or he was thinking about the ticket he got on the way to the meet.\r\n\r\nWith the 200’s rounded out, those teams who remained at the meet huddled to the side of the banked curve for a glimpse of the final distance race of the day: the ever elusive 3k. The Terps packed three women and three men into the fastest heats, and the gambling addicts that hadn’t gotten their fix since the 800s began throwing down large wagers: dimes, quarters, even full dollars!\r\n\r\nShannon MacMaster, Emily Hawkins, and Sarah Shapiro duked it out in the fast heat of the women’s 3k with Shapiro securing a 17th place finish, Hawkins scoring 8th (going under the previous club record by over 10 seconds), and MacMaster figuratively ending the lives of every racer in the field. MacMaster led the race from start to finish, securing first place, a free T-shirt, a 12 second victory over the nearest competitor, and a new club record of 10:33.31.\r\n\r\nTo the palpable dismay of Penn State Track Club’s president, the Maryland boys also performed excellently in 3k, with Matthew “Mike Wazowski” Laskowski locking down 6th place, and Colin “R2W” SyBing and Rylan “Strava” Flint going 1-2 <strong>respectively</strong> &lt;--- <em>very important</em>. While no club records were set, Flint notably shaved more than 10 seconds off his 3k time from this meet a year ago, and all athletes were proud of the performances.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the team “yeeted the heck out of there” after the 3k in order to dodge some impending snow on the drive home, diehard fans remained to witness the second fastest indoor 4x400m in club history from MacMaster, Evans, Mandich, and Heiges. The team was possibly most proud of Heiges defying all the haters and slashing time off her seed split of 80 seconds. The men’s team, as is custom, scratched out of the 4x400m. One of the prospective legs, when pressed for his reasoning for scratching, replied “Oh absolutely not.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, the Terps returned to College Park happy to be far away from Happy Valley, but proud of their early season performances and excited for the coming season.

The piece of land is basically a 400 meter wide sandbar that acts as a wind tunnel and sits between the Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic ocean. I have been a dedicated member of the Running2Win community since December 2016, logging my workouts and running adventures there for over 2 years now.

Well Tuesday, May 22nd, 2018, also happened to be the day I made a Strava account. While this was a tough decision, as I had been boycotting the app for some time, I was told there was a group for my area in which I could find many trails around where I lived, a feature Running2Win does not provide. Determined to not run the on the same exact straight road every single day this past summer, I took to the site to find some new routes.

While you may think this is a lavish reward, let me shed some light on the fact that this is actually a slap in the face.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          A pair of full length, solid color, Lululemon running tights, regular price, cost $98.00. 25% off means that these tights will cost $73.50. I’ll have you know that I recently purchased a pair of full length, lightning bolt patterned, Old Navy running tights, for $8.50. That’s right folks. $8.50. I’m sure you now understand why I was severely offended by Strava’s “generosity”.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          And while Strava is much easier to use and navigate, it lacks the intimate team aspect that Running2Win provides. We, UMD Club Running, have allowed r2w to evolve into a place where we can support each other through the the ups and the downs of our training.

I also found some other features Strava provides that r2w lacks:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ability to “like” each other’s runs</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- The ability to post photos(So if you run in the evening and are similar to my mom in the fact that you enjoy taking a picture of the sunset in the same exact spot every night post it on social media with an inspirational quote, this might appeal to you)</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Running challenges and goals that you can try to hit</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          But let me tell you about an experience I had with one of these challenges. I somehow joined a challenge, presented by Lululemon, in early January, that required you to run 80km by January 15th. Once I ran the 49.7097 miles, I was surprised to receive an email containing a 25% off coupon. While you may think this is a lavish reward, let me shed some light on the fact that this is actually a slap in the face.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          A pair of full length, solid color, Lululemon running tights, regular price, cost $98.00. 25% off means that these tights will cost $73.50. I’ll have you know that I recently purchased a pair of full length, lightning bolt patterned, Old Navy running tights, for $8.50. That’s right folks. $8.50. I’m sure you now understand why I was severely offended by Strava’s “generosity”.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          And while Strava is much easier to use and navigate, it lacks the intimate team aspect that Running2Win provides. We, UMD Club Running, have allowed r2w to evolve into a place where we can support each other through the the ups and the downs of our training. We have built a community on that terribly built website in which our infatuation with running is not only acceptable, but encouraged and we can vulnerably share our successes and failures with our teammates.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          A couple weeks ago, when I did a fartlek in Hyattsville, I accidentally peed in my pants TWO times. Did I feel comfortable writing about this experience on Strava? No. Did I feel comfortable writing about this experience on Running2Win? Absolutely. No one was from our team was going to judge me about that one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          Running2Win has taken on the role of my training diary and I gladly give it some of the credit for my successes over the past year. Take a look at a quote from my post from November 22nd. After briefly summarizing some of my running checkpoints of 2018, I wrote:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">          “So what I am saying is, thank you Maryland Club Running for letting me take on Vice President, become obsessed with running because of it and ultimately letting me reach my full potential. And thank you r2w for letting me exercise this obsession because even throughout this season, I was more motivated while using it, and the last 2-3 weeks were kinda rough training wise and I wasn\'t posting(coincidence? I think not).”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">           In conclusion, Running2Win is far superior to Strava, and if you haven’t signed up yet, you should!</span>', 'Running2Win Propaganda: Part 3', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '319-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-02-03 23:41:27', '2019-02-04 04:41:27', '', 319, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/319-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Today was the first day of spring. After breaking out the tank top on yesterday\'s long run I heard rumors of sixty degrees and clear blue skies in today\'s forecast. For those of you who may have seen me biking on campus today, you may have noticed me disappointingly toting around my pink and white plaid shorts underneath the slightly chilly grey skies. I had been duped by mother nature, and it was just another Monday morning in march.\r\n\r\nThen came 4:50, a much appreciated new time to get ready for the best part of the day and, lo(h) and behold, nothing but sunshine! Nothing, not even the Rec-Well audit, could get in my way of a great run now. After a particularly beautiful announcements speech by Colin, there were some desires to run Hills for Days. A decent idea in my opinion. Brian had just finished running it and I do appreciate the nature views on such a nice day, but it seemed a little short. Rylan offered that we could always add on after - I was down. Another circle, clearly more powerful, headed by Colin sauntered over to us and declared that they were doing Metro. I was down with doing a Greenbelt Metro. It\'s a solid run with some nature and I\'m sure it would be a chill run. Turns out, they were doing Metro Metro, like College Park Metro. I was very disappointed and pushed hard for Hills For Days. It was pointless, I had no sway.\r\n\r\nTaking my first, uneasy steps down Wellness Way (I had to look up the name of that street) Rylan came up to me and we began talking about trying to get to Greenbelt Lake. When we got to the Cherry Chill path we decided to send it. My question of \"Greenbelt Lake?\" was only answered by the same question with an entirely different inflection \"Greenbelt Lake?\" By the end of Cherry Chill Rylan and I realized we didn\'t really know where Greenbelt lake was, so we were gonnna do a Cherry Kill, or maybe it was reverse, either way it was new and exciting to me.\r\n\r\nThe new bridge at the end of the Cherry Chill path looks done, but a chain link fence blocked our path. Luckily I saw the adjacent road with a wide shoulder about 10 meters away when Rylan was about to ford the crick. After this shaky start the rest of our journey was quite successful; the apparently previously sus bridge was moderately friendly to runners and we didn\'t have to play frogger across the pre-rush hour beltway. Within 4 miles of campus we were already running through scenic fields and up never before seen hills. The new scenery combined with the beautiful weather put me in awe. A few turns and a few miles later we were already at Route 1, albeit a part unfamiliar to me, but much to my happiness we decided to continue onwards towards the \"ag fields\" as Rylan continued to call them. We ended up running through more fields that were very much worth the high speed limit on whatever road we were on. The juxtaposition of the open fields, the aging infrastructure, and the nearby urban route 1 was very notable and interesting.\r\n\r\nNearing mile 8 neither of us really knew where we were, but we were reassured when we turned onto Cherrywood Ln. It was aptly named and we slowly realized that we were, ironically, coming up on the Greenbelt Metro station and thus running by Greenbelt lake. We then got to walk through the, now rush hour, Greenbelt Metro station and we found our way to familiar Rhode Island ave. Our biggest disappointment on the run came when we were in the area of the historic Berwyn Metro walking tour. We were looking for a giant lima bean? Maybe it was a soybean? Either way, the bean was not to be found. The final stretch was notable for the beautiful, now dropping, sun and some really annoying gust of wind that came on the sidewalk up the parking lot and lasted strangely long.\r\n\r\nIn the end, did we run too far? Probably, but I also got to experience a beautiful new run on the day with the best weather of the year so far. I\'m proud that Rylan and I did not give in to the peer pressure of the easy run. I appreciate anyone who has made it this far in my completely random post. I thank Rylan for taking me on this run. And mostly I don\'t want to write my english essay. I have included a map of the run for anyone who wants to experience the awesomeness that is this yet to be named run because I will totally be running it again (I tried to upload the picture but I kept getting some weird error?).

Naps were taken, lunches were quickly devoured, and Sour Patch Kids: The Cereal became the topic of many heated debates.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, action picked right back up as Statsdybbsfivobgriegons, the only man to not scratch out of the open 400m, proved that yes, distance runners can go sub 60, or as historians refer to it, “sub-Steens.”\r\n\r\nThe energy provided from this performance carried on into the next event: the dreaded 800m. Apparel Coordinator Simone Evans, ironically without a club uniform, flew off the line boldly and scored a strong 4th place finish in 2:36, but even she agreed that, had she been wearing a uniform singlet, that 1st place would have been a piece of cake. As if to prove that freshman are the only people foolish enough to run this dumpster fire of an event, McCullough and Shire took to the track and recorded some promising beginning of the season performances. Shire negative split his way to a 2:06, while McCullough thundered away from the field with 400m to go to take first place in the 500m dash, only to be savagely passed by 3 other competitors as he barreled through the last 300m to finish in 2:02.\r\n\r\nFresh from foregoing the open 400m, newcomers Killea and Harry Rentzeperis joined veteran Ian Lynch for the 200m dash (who was rebounding from an earlier performance in the 60m dash), where the big boys laid out an impressive spread of 8th (Rentzeperis), 13th (Killea), and 25th (Lynch). While not confirmed, it is speculated that former Sprint Chair Matthew Marcel looked on the 200m with a single tear of pride rolling down his face, his heart warmed by the efforts of the active sprinter core. Either that or he was thinking about the ticket he got on the way to the meet.\r\n\r\nWith the 200’s rounded out, those teams who remained at the meet huddled to the side of the banked curve for a glimpse of the final distance race of the day: the ever elusive 3k. The Terps packed three women and three men into the fastest heats, and the gambling addicts that hadn’t gotten their fix since the 800s began throwing down large wagers: dimes, quarters, even full dollars!\r\n\r\nShannon MacMaster, Emily Hawkins, and Sarah Shapiro duked it out in the fast heat of the women’s 3k with Shapiro securing a 17th place finish, Hawkins scoring 8th (going under the previous club record by over 10 seconds), and MacMaster figuratively ending the lives of every racer in the field. MacMaster led the race from start to finish, securing first place, a free T-shirt, a 12 second victory over the nearest competitor, and a new club record of 10:33.31.\r\n\r\nTo the palpable dismay of Penn State Track Club’s president, the Maryland boys also performed excellently in 3k, with Matthew “Mike Wazowski” Laskowski locking down 6th place, and Colin “R2W” SyBing and Rylan “Strava” Flint going 1-2 <strong>respectively</strong> &lt;--- <em>very important</em>. While no club records were set, Flint notably shaved more than 10 seconds off his 3k time from this meet a year ago, and all athletes were proud of the performances.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the team “yeeted the heck out of there” after the 3k in order to dodge some impending snow on the drive home, diehard fans remained to witness the second fastest indoor 4x400m in club history from MacMaster, Evans, Mandich, and Heiges. The team was possibly most proud of Heiges defying all the haters and slashing time off her seed split of 80 seconds. The men’s team, as is custom, scratched out of the 4x400m. One of the prospective legs, when pressed for his reasoning for scratching, replied “Oh absolutely not.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, the Terps returned to College Park happy to be far away from Happy Valley, but proud of their early season performances and excited for the coming season. Next: Capital Relays at American University.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YLkQdu-CyNt1oSMSXBLUyGuouCGdS4VfFaiu_hbA1LLybLEHdUCtdh3c_YbE13QexgF1BZ-JB9ShQHGuoJfUg6oAaDA6LOvL4JlgDgJf7QxVHT1Kz6WPNB8Cu9zJ-FLMBuwaM8VGgp7wGnr1aN5kS0sq62mPvr7dsRCnVfyBxmTwZqSzo5SLqQdMoQh9RTGyPZgcMWItGu0EyeWcvAPm3_Jyp9c9cQBaMrQL8t8nAaZDov8FaExqg6lxbG43DfQqXVEdac2qUFH_djWll1FCOJ_7sTZagC42V3tnYEixystTzBgjQSdfypyWzt_GiIooSsrS1hPwv2NoaEUXogxc_GbRhwoFoAaklug7bB1O5oLTlrZxuyrh_bCS5HREV1qmlxr3H9w5WTWR11Im397y62LSw31T_pmbulfNhEfn9WuqPlyOJdDfWRcPYtd0fIi0EPHcKL9Zynrc2REBcDl7MnpBU55SD_tyhsZPRpW4Q1vAs_EoadFm10mdyducTcqDLGYsBA10_R3qE84O_aWU39BDfcYiw5_Mt0wbeG4OBIHlzqBlx7ddhenhaOS4kEYTh9UCU-ECC2M4e3tjv15t9w9Oqza3UIW3mhWhaosNttIlgDOl4oDli-Xb2y1GYMGV0M19dujl3X4JI9Yrl9cHG5PwuM-ZmqOihdjP7XjxdF67LHJ88g4xroqLdpYf_bcFtQBTYfH-qhmnL3Mf4CgLBgoG=w1357-h904-no\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Happy Valley Recap', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '330-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-02-16 21:19:35', '2019-02-17 02:19:35', '', 330, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/330-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This strong start for Maryland was followed by the men’s 5k. Mitch Welter finished second in 16:20 while wearing trainers. Ryun Anderson can be loosely quoted as saying, “Mitch totally would have thrashed that Georgetown guy (the first-place finisher) if he was wearing spikes and not on pacing duties”. Matt Laskowski, Welter’s pacee, finished third in 16:36. Also in the field was Adolfo Blassino who shocked spectators with a mid-race wardrobe change.

(339, 36, '2019-03-11 21:22:52', '2019-03-12 01:22:52', 'I don\'t care what scientists say. I don\'t care what the general public says. And I definitely don\'t care what Punxsutawney Phil says. Today was the first day of spring. After breaking out the tank top on yesterday\'s long run I heard rumors of sixty degrees and clear blue skies in today\'s forecast. For those of you who may have seen me biking on campus today, you may have noticed me disappointingly toting around my pink and white plaid shorts underneath the slightly chilly grey skies. I had been duped by mother nature, and it was just another Monday morning in march.\r\n\r\nThen came 4:50, a much appreciated new time to get ready for the best part of the day and, lo(h) and behold, nothing but sunshine! Nothing, not even the Rec-Well audit, could get in my way of a great run now. After a particularly beautiful announcements speech by Colin, there were some desires to run Hills for Days. A decent idea in my opinion. Brian had just finished running it and I do appreciate the nature views on such a nice day, but it seemed a little short. Rylan offered that we could always add on after - I was down. Another circle, clearly more powerful, headed by Colin sauntered over to us and declared that they were doing Metro. I was down with doing a Greenbelt Metro. It\'s a solid run with some nature and I\'m sure it would be a chill run. Turns out, they were doing Metro Metro, like College Park Metro. I was very disappointed and pushed hard for Hills For Days. It was pointless, I had no sway.\r\n\r\nTaking my first, uneasy steps down Wellness Way (I had to look up the name of that street) Rylan came up to me and we began talking about trying to get to Greenbelt Lake. When we got to the Cherry Chill path we decided to send it. My question of \"Greenbelt Lake?\" was only answered by the same question with an entirely different inflection \"Greenbelt Lake?\" By the end of Cherry Chill Rylan and I realized we didn\'t really know where Greenbelt lake was, so we were gonnna do a Cherry Kill, or maybe it was reverse, either way it was new and exciting to me.\r\n\r\nThe new bridge at the end of the Cherry Chill path looks done, but a chain link fence blocked our path. Luckily I saw the adjacent road with a wide shoulder about 10 meters away when Rylan was about to ford the crick. After this shaky start the rest of our journey was quite successful; the apparently previously sus bridge was moderately friendly to runners and we didn\'t have to play frogger across the pre-rush hour beltway. Within 4 miles of campus we were already running through scenic fields and up never before seen hills. The new scenery combined with the beautiful weather put me in awe. A few turns and a few miles later we were already at Route 1, albeit a part unfamiliar to me, but much to my happiness we decided to continue onwards towards the \"ag fields\" as Rylan continued to call them. We ended up running through more fields that were very much worth the high speed limit on whatever road we were on. The juxtaposition of the open fields, the aging infrastructure, and the nearby urban route 1 was very notable and interesting.\r\n\r\nNearing mile 8 neither of us really knew where we were, but we were reassured when we turned onto Cherrywood Ln. It was aptly named and we slowly realized that we were, ironically, coming up on the Greenbelt Metro station and thus running by Greenbelt lake. We then got to walk through the, now rush hour, Greenbelt Metro station and we found our way to familiar Rhode Island ave. Our biggest disappointment on the run came when we were in the area of the historic Berwyn Metro walking tour. We were looking for a giant lima bean? Maybe it was a soybean? Either way, the bean was not to be found. The final stretch was notable for the beautiful, now dropping, sun and some really annoying gust of wind that came on the sidewalk up the parking lot and lasted strangely long.\r\n\r\nIn the end, did we run too far? Probably, but I also got to experience a beautiful new run on the day with the best weather of the year so far. I\'m proud that Rylan and I did not give in to the peer pressure of the easy run. I appreciate anyone who has made it this far in my completely random post. I thank Rylan for taking me on this run. And mostly I don\'t want to write my english essay. I have included a map of the run for anyone who wants to experience the awesomeness that is this yet to be named run because I will totally be running it again (I tried to upload the picture but I kept getting some weird error?). Only 4 more days till break.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\n\r\nMatthew Stasiukevicius', 'The First Day of Spring', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '338-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-03-11 21:22:52', '2019-03-12 01:22:52', '', 338, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/338-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

What they planned next was the first rendition of the NIRCA Spring Track Championships, including only a half marathon, a select few distance and sprint events, and excluding all field events. Over the years it has grown, improved, and morphed alongside college club running culture into the gorgeous and eclectic extravaganza full of elite caliber athletes, dedicated running junkies, and absurdist meme lords. It is this alternate universe that UMD Club Running entered as four rental vans, fresh with a coating of Indiana highway dust, pulled into the parking lot of the track the University of Miami of Ohio. Fueled by a burning desire to compete, coasting off the strength of months of consistent training, and motivated by a coaching staff of broke boiz Ryun Anderson and myself (who entered the meet armed with 9 clipboards primed for smashing in celebration/frustration), UMD Club athletes pit themselves against club athletes from all over the country.\n\nTrack action got off to a quick start in the 100m prelims, with Ian Lynch finishing in 13.44s and Kareem McDavid in 11.98s. Onlookers sat amazed not only at the performances, but at the fervor with which UMD Club athletes cheered on the “Kareem of the Crop,” specifically with how they continuously smashed a clipboard on a fence, trying to break it in celebration. One NIRCA representative even praised the team’s spirit, stating “Yeah, don’t do that.” Inspired by this feedback, Treasurer Brian McCullough responded by severing the first clipboard of the day with his knee, technically heeding the advice of the NIRCA representative. Immediately following the 100m dash, lone hurdler Dylan Briske began his triple event weekend with a 1:10.58s finish, where he miraculously did not have to jump over his blocks as he finished this time.\n\nFans relocated themselves around the track to achieve maximum cheering volume for the next event: the women’s 5k. The first of two heats featured Maddie Mandich, who even-split her way to a season PR of 21:48, while only being minorly distracted by the pack of wild animals in UMD clothes willing her on with creative chants from the other side of the fence (earning UMD Club a feature on NIRCA’s Instagram story). Mandich’s time was almost a 70 second improvement from her time at the Terrapin Invite a week prior. The second (and final) heat of the women’s 5k featured the dynamic roommate duo of Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster. Heiges fought hard to a time of 20:26, while MacMaster pulled away from all but three runners, placing 4th for an All-American finish with an absolutely absurd time of 17:48, going under the previous club record by over 40 seconds and PR’ing by a similar amount. Onlookers sat dumbstruck by the performance, and some coaches and their assistants were so excited that they even destroyed their own clipboards (that’s 2 and 3 right there). MacMaster would immediately celebrate this performance by skipping the awards ceremony in favor of an extended cooldown.\n\nAttention turned back to the sprint squad, as McDavid and Lynch doubled back to run 23.72s and 26.83s respectively in the 200m dash, while Corey Townsend, well warmed up after driving back the hotel to grab his spikes, stepped on the track and laid down a 25.84s performance.\n\nJust as quickly as the they left the track, the women’s distance team returned to field a 4 x 800m relay composed of a doubling Heiges and Mandich and a fresh pair of 800 specialists: Kate Eckart and Katrina Hrabinski. Hrabinski executed a tactically flawless 2:25 lead-off leg, complete with a certifiably feral final 200m in which she passed 3 competitors and handed off in 4th place. Heiges held her ground well against competitors in the second leg with a 2:49, passing off to Mandich, who, even on tired legs, smashed out a 2:56. Eckart anchored the way home, making two key passes on her way to a 2:26, securing a 7th place finish for women’s 4 x 8 in 10:37, which incidentally ensured that every single female competitor from UMD earned an All-American award.\n\nAfter a couple boring sprint semifinals immediately following the 4x8’s (in which, I would like to point out, the winning men’s time was 7:49 holy moly), the stage was set for 2 hours of pure endurance, agony, and passion. Yes, it was time for a NIRCA Nats special: 6 heats of men’s 5ks, and luckily enough for UMD, we managed to have someone in each heat of the 5k. Don’t ever say we don’t have a wide pace range on this club. Teammates flooded the infield to shriek encouragement over every inch of the track.\n\nOur first competitor was Matt Sebsibe, who, emboldened by his first track 5k in spikes, ran a smart race from beginning to end, passing competitors the entire way, including one particularly bold pass that just so happened to end the life of the fourth clipboard of the day. Sebsibe would close the final 200m in 38s for a massive season PR of 18:28. Justin Turner entered his heat in his traditional modest fashion, and then proceeded to prove that he was actually hustling us the whole time, like that episode of Drake and Josh where Josh is really good at billiards. Good times. Stating that his “stretch-goal” for the race was a 17:40 due to lack of consistent training, Turner proceeded to chase the front pack for his first mile, which took him out in 5:24. While the pace may have waned as the race went on, the effort never did, and Turner proved that by shifting gears from 42 second 200’s to ~37 second 200’s in the final 600m, for a very near lifetime PR of 17:28, well past Turner’s stretch goal.\n\nHeat three was populated by two club veterans: Vice President San Dinger and Resident-Guy-Named-Briggs Briggs. In a show of pure NIRCA spirit, your very own VP charged out in the front and provoked the crowd for noise, “meming” his way through the first mile in 5:10. Briggs, as a change of pace, was not the meme of this race and took the more modest approach, even-splitting his first two miles. Singer would later pull away from the field alongside two other competitors to set a lifetime PR of 16:19 (though he could not defeat the heat winner, the grossly mis-seeded “grown-ass man,” Virginia Tech’s Harry Wood), while Briggs was narrowly edged out by the women’s 5k champion by about 7 seconds, running 17:09.\n\nHeat 4 marked the beginning of the year of the Matt, as freshmen duo Matt Laskowski and Matt Stasiukevicius duked it out with an incredibly deep field. Laskowski, a self-proclaimed “no-kick” kind of runner, poured his energy into the first two miles, hanging on to the lead pack to shoot for a quick time, while Stas tucked into the back of the field. At the end of mile two, Stas seemingly floated past the enormous field to take second place in a staggering PR of 15:46. Laskowski would follow soon behind in a huge PR of 16:06. The two would commemorate their PR’s with a two halves of deservedly smashed clipboard number 5. Heat 5 featured a notably hat-less Rylan Flint, who sat perfectly relaxed on the leaders for 2 miles. Flint executed a clever race strategy that carried him to a lifetime PR of 15:34, which also earned him a finish in the top 20.\n\nFinally, exhausted fans on the infield stepped up to their final challenge of the gauntlet: cheering on the fast heat of the men’s 5k, starring hometown hero Mitch Welter. Welter, who missed the entirety of his freshman and sophomore seasons of outdoor track due to nagging injuries, entered his first track championship with grand expectations. Excitement rode high for 8 laps as an enormous pack of about 20 runners stayed bunched in the front, each of them flirting with 15-flat pace. Welter positioned himself perfectly in front of a tidal wave of runners, sometimes even pushing up to challenge the leader himself. The paced certainly lagged a bit in the middle mile (if you can call 4:55 lagging) as leaders interchanged, and it wasn’t until about 4.5 laps to go when the pack at the front burst, giving way to a line of runners all battling for a podium spot. While fans watched on in uncertainty, Welter never faltered in the final mile, blowing by two competitors in the final lap in about 65 seconds to seal a 15:09 PR and a 6th place finish as an All-American. Fittingly, Welter’s 6th place finish doomed the 6th clipboard to same fate as its predecessors, and just like that, the long, tired days of 5k’s were finally over.\n\nDuring the endless storm of 5k’s, Briske had recovered from his stint as a hurdler and snuck in a 4.94m long jump performance. However, Briske’s day was far from over, as he stepped up alongside Townsend, Lynch, and McDavid in the men’s 4 x 100m. Excessive amounts of “salt” were reportedly pumped through McDavid’s veins as the UMD men’s 4 x 100m wrapped up the event with a ~67% handoff success rate. However, as any STEM student will tell you, 67% is typically a C+ with the curve, and everyone knows that C’s get degrees.\n\nThe long day was wrapped up with the 1500m. Mandich stepped up to complete a tough triple of 5k, 4x8, and 1500, as she savagely flexed on two girls before essentially erasing them from existence as she kicked past them, hitting a season PR of 5:55 despite the fatigue.\n\nMandich’s performance was followed by the loaded final heat of the women’s 1500m, which featured a star-studded squad of MacMaster, Hrabinski, and Eckart. MacMaster, a self-proclaimed “5k-runner,” glided to the front of that race alongside Penn State’s Suzanne Stein (last year’s 5k champ) and Purdue’s Lucy Hilarides (this year’s 5k champ, who ran 17:02 earlier and also destroyed Briggs’ will to exist). Up against seasoned competitors with such storied credentials, it seemed, at least to the fans, as though a third-place finish would be a perfectly reasonable for MacMaster.\nThat’s what made the subsequent events so utterly astonishing; MacMaster threw in a surge with 500m to go and hit the bell lap in the lead. UMD athletes scrambled in a frenzy around the infield to will her onwards, hoping to help her outlast the imminent kick of Hilarides and Stein.\n\nHowever, MacMaster’s lead on the two champs only grew, until about the 200m, when fans began to suspect that the kick simply wasn’t coming from the second and third runners. Indeed, MacMaster powered downed the final straightaway as UMD athletes screamed themselves hoarse to celebrate UMD Club Runnings’ second ever NIRCA National Champion (and first ever female one): Shannon MacMaster, 1500m, 4:44.13. MacMaster’s mark obliterated her own club record from a week prior by 4 seconds, and she was joined at the finish line by Hrabinski, who was narrowly edged out of 9th place in 5:02, and Eckart, who improved upon her previous PR by 2 seconds in 5:08. Coach Anderson, moved by his team’s effort and the history he had witnessed, blasted the seventh clipboard out of existence, and turned to focus on the final few races of the day.\n\nAfter a wildly successful race by the women, the excitement seemed to bleed into the first heat of the men’s 1500m. Comeback kid Nate Lieske was unfortunately foiled by the track officials, who controversially denied his God-given right to race in an oversized bunny mascot head that he purchased at Wal Mart a day prior. Nevertheless, Lieske proceeded to dazzle the crowd with his ceremonial handcrafted Jorts, as he laid out his first official track race as a UMD Club athlete in 5:08, sealing the last 50m whilst eating a carrot that he had in his pocket the while time. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner all doubled back after their 5k’s to run what Coach Anderson refers to as “literally everyone’s 1500,” complete with (1) an unnecessarily fast first lap, (2) an incredibly slow second lap, and (3), in the case of Turner specifically, “WHEEEEEELS” in the last 400m. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner finished in separate heats with times of 4:54, 4:35, and 4:33, all of them featuring some very pronounced acceleration in the final lap.\n\nThe absolute final race of the day belonged to McCullough, whose most pronounced exertion of the meet thus far had been smashing the team’s first clipboard. Hoping to score from the 2nd to fastest heat, McCullough shot off the line surrounded by a dense crowd of what could only be described as “mouth-breathers.” While inhibited slightly by the traffic surrounded him, McCullough reportedly channeled several spirits and attained Nirvana as he unleashed his kick in the final 300m, earning him a 13th place finish in 4:04.\n\nAfter some brief lunch in downtown Oxford, the team returned to quiet Connersville, Indiana, to rest up for the second day of Nationals competition.\n<h3>Day 2: The Biggest Storm that Never Happened</h3>\nNerves were tense on Saturday night, as the outlook on Sunday’s weather looked dismal: rain and thunderstorms from 8AM to 3PM, which incidentally, was exactly when the meet was scheduled to take place. NIRCA drafted contingency and cancellation plans for both the half marathon and the final track events of the weekend, and UMD Club Running did the same. In order to keep people out of the rain as much as possible, the team elected to shuffle the car assignments to send the car of half marathon runners to the meet on time, while allowing the rest of the team to sleep an extra two hours and keep out of the rain.\n\nThese plans, while thoughtful, proved overly cautious, as the storm shifted away from Oxford, leading to slight drizzles in the morning that soon gave way to completely clear skies. Half marathoners took advantage of this miraculous turn of events to bring even more hardware for the club. Spurred on by an unencumbered Mitch Welter, who furiously shuttled himself around the half marathon course to catch a glimpse of the race whilst blaring the Pokémon theme song, the seven half marathoners of UMD flew over Oxford hills before making a beeline back to the track for the finish.\n\nNot only did Adolfo Blassino win the first 400m of the race (which, in the end, is the part that matters), but Rylan Flint, rebounding off of a stellar 5k PR from Saturday, stunned the field and the spectators as he blazed back on to the track to win the race in 1:13:23 by over 20 seconds, making him the Club’s second NIRCA National Champion of the weekend and the third in history. While the reaction to the victory was certainly delayed, Flint’s performance was deemed too impressive to allow another clipboard to survive, and thus, clipboard number 8 met its end in emphatic fashion. Flint not only smashed the oldest record on the club record books (2007, incidentally the only record not from this decade) by over 2 minutes, but led the male half marathoners of UMD to a third place finish. Indeed, the half marathon was scored by taking the total time of the top three runners from each team, meaning that new All-American Brian McCullough (8th, 1:16:23) and VP Daniel Singer (27th, 1:21:52) helped earn a shiny new trophy for the Terps. Supporting them was Jack Reimer (42nd, 1:24:47) and Blassino (54th, 1:26:46).\n\nWhile not fielding enough runners to be scored as a team, ever-together pair Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster ran side by side for the entire race, with Heiges kicking past MacMaster in the final 100m in thrilling fashion. That kick earned Heiges a 10th place, All-American finish and MacMaster 11th place, both with times of 1:35:23.\n\nOnce the half marathon had cleared off the track, the sun broke out of the clouds and the 800m finals began. Maddie Mandich completed the toughest schedule of any UMD athlete by completing a quadruple of 5k, 4x8, 1500, and 800. Mandich would run 2:46, improving on her 4x8 split from a day before by nearly 10 seconds. A couple heats later, Mandich’s 4x8 teammate Kate Eckart was back on the track in the fastest heat, where she blazed out a first 400m in 70 seconds before making several key passes on the final 200m, finishing in 2:25. Uncertainty permeated the air as the teams awaited results, as a few runners from the second fastest heat finished awfully close to the finishers in the fastest heat. However, it soon became clear that Eckart’s final kick had paid off; she placed 8th and earned her second All-American award of the weekend.\n\nLone wolf Matt Stasiukevicius was eager to show off his range after his monstrous 5k PR on Saturday, and it became apparent that nobody else on the team was. UMD fans waited through nine heats of 800’s before Stas graced them with an impressive show of speed for a 5k runner, splitting just below 60 seconds for the first lap and rounding out the finish in 2:04.\nFinally, after a short day of track competition, UMD’s final race of the day arrived in the form of Katrina Hrabinski’s 3k steeplechase. Choosing to forego the 800m, Hrabinski walked into the finals as fresh as anyone could be after two hard races the day before. Hrabinski was racing the event for only the second time in her college career, and she employed a unique “heel-clicking” steeple form to battle it out with two Michigan competitors before sealing her second All-American finish of the weekend in a new club record of 12:12, good for 5th place. While spectators were forced to wait an extra hour for Hrabinski’s award to be given out, I think there can be no disagreement that the wait was well worth it. Sayonara, clipboard number 9!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/UMDclubrunning/status/1117502292926894082\n\nUMD Club Running pulled up to Miami of Ohio at 7:30AM on a Saturday morning. Two days later, they left with a four new club records (two from Macmaster, one from Flint, and one from Hrabinski), two national champions, twelve All-American awards, three separate features on NIRCA’s Instagram story, twelve confirmed lifetime PR’s, two newly mute coaches, zero Tinder matches, and notably, without the ability to simultaneously have nine people write things down against a portable firm surface whilst standing up. However, while NIRCA Nationals is always a season highlight, the season is far from over. Stay tuned for our final four track meets and the Frederick Half Marathon!', 'Nationals Recap', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'nationals-recap', '', '', '2019-04-15 14:09:13', '2019-04-15 18:09:13', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=346', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(347, 33, '2019-04-15 02:08:07', '2019-04-15 06:08:07', 'Day 1: Courage, Camaraderie, and Clipboards\r\n\r\n7 years ago, a plucky organization of volunteers who had previously planned nothing but half marathons and other road races decided that it was time to expand their race repertoire to better serve the college runners that frequented their races. What they planned next was the first rendition of the NIRCA Spring Track Championships, including only a half marathon, a select few distance and sprint events, and excluding all field events. Over the years it has grown, improved, and morphed alongside college club running culture into the gorgeous and eclectic extravaganza full of elite caliber athletes, dedicated running junkies, and absurdist meme lords. It is this alternate universe that UMD Club Running entered as four rental vans, fresh with a coating of Indiana highway dust, pulled into the parking lot of the track the University of Miami of Ohio. Fueled by a burning desire to compete, coasting off the strength of months of consistent training, and motivated by a coaching staff of broke boiz Ryun Anderson and myself (who entered the meet armed with 9 clipboards primed for smashing in celebration/frustration), UMD Club athletes pit themselves against club athletes from all over the country. \r\nTrack action got off to a quick start in the 100m prelims, with Ian Lynch finishing in 13.44s and Kareem McDavid in 11.98s. Onlookers sat amazed not only at the performances, but at the fervor with which UMD Club athletes cheered on the “Kareem of the Crop,” specifically with how they continuously smashed a clipboard on a fence, trying to break it in celebration. One NIRCA representative even praised the team’s spirit, stating “Yeah, don’t do that.” Inspired by this feedback, Treasurer Brian McCullough responded by severing the first clipboard of the day with his knee, technically heeding the advice of the NIRCA representative. Immediately following the 100m dash, lone hurdler Dylan Briske began his triple event weekend with a 1:10.58s finish, where he miraculously did not have to jump over his blocks as he finished this time.\r\nFans relocated themselves around the track to achieve maximum cheering volume for the next event: the women’s 5k. The first of two heats featured Maddie Mandich, who even-split her way to a season PR of 21:48, while only being minorly distracted by the pack of wild animals in UMD clothes willing her on with creative chants from the other side of the fence (earning UMD Club a feature on NIRCA’s Instagram story). Mandich’s time was almost a 70 second improvement from her time at the Terrapin Invite a week prior. The second (and final) heat of the women’s 5k featured the dynamic roommate duo of Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster. Heiges fought hard to a time of 20:26, while MacMaster pulled away from all but three runners, placing 4th for an All-American finish with an absolutely absurd time of 17:48, going under the previous club record by over 40 seconds and PR’ing by a similar amount. Onlookers sat dumbstruck by the performance, and some coaches and their assistants were so excited that they even destroyed their own clipboards (that’s 2 and 3 right there). MacMaster would immediately celebrate this performance by skipping the awards ceremony in favor of an extended cooldown.\r\nAttention turned back to the sprint squad, as McDavid and Lynch doubled back to run 23.72s and 26.83s respectively in the 200m dash, while Corey Townsend, well warmed up after driving back the hotel to grab his spikes, stepped on the track and laid down a 25.84s performance.\r\nJust as quickly as the they left the track, the women’s distance team returned to field a 4 x 800m relay composed of a doubling Heiges and Mandich and a fresh pair of 800 specialists: Kate Eckart and Katrina Hrabinski. Hrabinski executed a tactically flawless 2:25 lead-off leg, complete with a certifiably feral final 200m in which she passed 3 competitors and handed off in 4th place. Heiges held her ground well against competitors in the second leg with a 2:49, passing off to Mandich, who, even on tired legs, smashed out a 2:56. Eckart anchored the way home, making two key passes on her way to a 2:26, securing a 7th place finish for women’s 4 x 8 in 10:37, which incidentally ensured that every single female competitor from UMD earned an All-American award. \r\nAfter a couple boring sprint semifinals immediately following the 4x8’s (in which, I would like to point out, the winning men’s time was 7:49 holy moly), the stage was set for 2 hours of pure endurance, agony, and passion. Yes, it was time for a NIRCA Nats special: 6 heats of men’s 5ks, and luckily enough for UMD, we managed to have someone in each heat of the 5k. Don’t ever say we don’t have a wide pace range on this club. Teammates flooded the infield to shriek encouragement over every inch of the track.\r\n Our first competitor was Matt Sebsibe, who, emboldened by his first track 5k in spikes, ran a smart race from beginning to end, passing competitors the entire way, including one particularly bold pass that just so happened to end the life of the fourth clipboard of the day. Sebsibe would close the final 200m in 38s for a massive season PR of 18:28. Justin Turner entered his heat in his traditional modest fashion, and then proceeded to prove that he was actually hustling us the whole time, like that episode of Drake and Josh where Josh is really good at billiards. Good times. Stating that his “stretch-goal” for the race was a 17:40 due to lack of consistent training, Turner proceeded to chase the front pack for his first mile, which took him out in 5:24. While the pace may have waned as the race went on, the effort never did, and Turner proved that by shifting gears from 42 second 200’s to ~37 second 200’s in the final 600m, for a very near lifetime PR of 17:28, well past Turner’s stretch goal.\r\nHeat three was populated by two club veterans: Vice President San Dinger and Resident-Guy-Named-Briggs Briggs. In a show of pure NIRCA spirit, your very own VP charged out in the front and provoked the crowd for noise, “meming” his way through the first mile in 5:10. Briggs, as a change of pace, was not the meme of this race and took the more modest approach, even-splitting his first two miles. Singer would later pull away from the field alongside two other competitors to set a lifetime PR of 16:19 (though he could not defeat the heat winner, the grossly mis-seeded “grown-ass man,” Virginia Tech’s Harry Wood), while Briggs was narrowly edged out by the women’s 5k champion by about 7 seconds, running 17:09. \r\nHeat 4 marked the beginning of the year of the Matt, as freshmen duo Matt Laskowski and Matt Stasiukevicius duked it out with an incredibly deep field. Laskowski, a self-proclaimed “no-kick” kind of runner, poured his energy into the first two miles, hanging on to the lead pack to shoot for a quick time, while Stas tucked into the back of the field. At the end of mile two, Stas seemingly floated past the enormous field to take second place in a staggering PR of 15:46. Laskowski would follow soon behind in a huge PR of 16:06. The two would commemorate their PR’s with a two halves of deservedly smashed clipboard number 5. Heat 5 featured a notably hat-less Rylan Flint, who sat perfectly relaxed on the leaders for 2 miles. Flint executed a clever race strategy that carried him to a lifetime PR of 15:34, which also earned him a finish in the top 20.\r\nFinally, exhausted fans on the infield stepped up to their final challenge of the gauntlet: cheering on the fast heat of the men’s 5k, starring hometown hero Mitch Welter. Welter, who missed the entirety of his freshman and sophomore seasons of outdoor track due to nagging injuries, entered his first track championship with grand expectations. Excitement rode high for 8 laps as an enormous pack of about 20 runners stayed bunched in the front, each of them flirting with 15-flat pace. Welter positioned himself perfectly in front of a tidal wave of runners, sometimes even pushing up to challenge the leader himself. The paced certainly lagged a bit in the middle mile (if you can call 4:55 lagging) as leaders interchanged, and it wasn’t until about 4.5 laps to go when the pack at the front burst, giving way to a line of runners all battling for a podium spot. While fans watched on in uncertainty, Welter never faltered in the final mile, blowing by two competitors in the final lap in about 65 seconds to seal a 15:09 PR and a 6th place finish as an All-American. Fittingly, Welter’s 6th place finish doomed the 6th clipboard to same fate as its predecessors, and just like that, the long, tired days of 5k’s were finally over.\r\nDuring the endless storm of 5k’s, Briske had recovered from his stint as a hurdler and snuck in a 4.94m long jump performance. However, Briske’s day was far from over, as he stepped up alongside Townsend, Lynch, and McDavid in the men’s 4 x 100m. Excessive amounts of “salt” were reportedly pumped through McDavid’s veins as the UMD men’s 4 x 100m wrapped up the event with a ~67% handoff success rate. However, as any STEM student will tell you, 67% is typically a C+ with the curve, and everyone knows that C’s get degrees.\r\nThe long day was wrapped up with the 1500m. Mandich stepped up to complete a tough triple of 5k, 4x8, and 1500, as she savagely flexed on two girls before essentially erasing them from existence as she kicked past them, hitting a season PR of 5:55 despite the fatigue. \r\nMandich’s performance was followed by the loaded final heat of the women’s 1500m, which featured a star-studded squad of MacMaster, Hrabinski, and Eckart. MacMaster, a self-proclaimed “5k-runner,” glided to the front of that race alongside Penn State’s Suzanne Stein (last year’s 5k champ) and Purdue’s Lucy Hilarides (this year’s 5k champ, who ran 17:02 earlier and also destroyed Briggs’ will to exist). Up against seasoned competitors with such storied credentials, it seemed, at least to the fans, as though a third-place finish would be a perfectly reasonable for MacMaster.\r\nThat’s what made the subsequent events so utterly astonishing; MacMaster threw in a surge with 500m to go and hit the bell lap in the lead. UMD athletes scrambled in a frenzy around the infield to will her onwards, hoping to help her outlast the imminent kick of Hilarides and Stein. However, MacMaster’s lead on the two champs only grew, until about the 200m, when fans began to suspect that the kick simply wasn’t coming from the second and third runners. Indeed, MacMaster powered downed the final straightaway as UMD athletes screamed themselves hoarse to celebrate UMD Club Runnings’ second ever NIRCA National Champion (and first ever female one): Shannon MacMaster, 1500m, 4:44.13. MacMaster’s mark obliterated her own club record from a week prior by 4 seconds, and she was joined at the finish line by Hrabinski, who was narrowly edged out of 9th place in 5:02, and Eckart, who improved upon her previous PR by 2 seconds in 5:08. Coach Anderson, moved by his team’s effort and the history he had witnessed, blasted the seventh clipboard out of existence, and turned to focus on the final few races of the day.\r\nAfter a wildly successful race by the women, the excitement seemed to bleed into the first heat of the men’s 1500m. Comeback kid Nate Lieske was unfortunately foiled by the track officials, who controversially denied his God-given right to race in an oversized bunny mascot head that he purchased at Wal Mart a day prior. Nevertheless, Lieske proceeded to dazzle the crowd with his ceremonial handcrafted Jorts, as he laid out his first official track race as a UMD Club athlete in 5:08, sealing the last 50m whilst eating a carrot that he had in his pocket the while time. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner all doubled back after their 5k’s to run what Coach Anderson refers to as “literally everyone’s 1500,” complete with (1) an unnecessarily fast first lap, (2) an incredibly slow second lap, and (3), in the case of Turner specifically, “WHEEEEEELS” in the last 400m. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner finished in separate heats with times of 4:54, 4:35, and 4:33, all of them featuring some very pronounced acceleration in the final lap.\r\nThe absolute final race of the day belonged to McCullough, whose most pronounced exertion of the meet thus far had been smashing the team’s first clipboard. Hoping to score from the 2nd to fastest heat, McCullough shot off the line surrounded by a dense crowd of what could only be described as “mouth-breathers.” While inhibited slightly by the traffic surrounded him, McCullough reportedly channeled several spirits and attained Nirvana as he unleashed his kick in the final 300m, earning him a 13th place finish in 4:04.\r\nAfter some brief lunch in downtown Oxford, the team returned to quiet Connersville, Indiana, to rest up for the second day of Nationals competition.\r\n\r\nDay 2: The Biggest Storm that Never Happened\r\n\r\nNerves were tense on Saturday night, as the outlook on Sunday’s weather looked dismal: rain and thunderstorms from 8AM to 3PM, which incidentally, was exactly when the meet was scheduled to take place. NIRCA drafted contingency and cancellation plans for both the half marathon and the final track events of the weekend, and UMD Club Running did the same. In order to keep people out of the rain as much as possible, the team elected to shuffle the car assignments to send the car of half marathon runners to the meet on time, while allowing the rest of the team to sleep an extra two hours and keep out of the rain.\r\nThese plans, while thoughtful, proved overly cautious, as the storm shifted away from Oxford, leading to slight drizzles in the morning that soon gave way to completely clear skies.

While certainly delayed, Flint’s performance was deemed too impressive to allow another clipboard to survive, and thus, clipboard number 8 met its end in emphatic fashion. Flint not only smashed the oldest record on the club record books (2007, incidentally the only record not from this decade) by over 2 minutes, but led the male half marathoners of UMD to a third place finish. Indeed, the half marathon was scored by taking the total time of the top three runners from each team, meaning that new All-American Brian McCullough (8th, 1:16:23) and VP Daniel Singer (27th, 1:21:52) helped earn a shiny new trophy for the Terps. Supporting them was Jack Reimer (42nd, 1:24:47) and Blassino (54th, 1:26:46).\r\nWhile not fielding enough runners to be scored as a team, ever-together pair Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster ran side by side for the entire race, with Heiges kicking past MacMaster in the final 100m in thrilling fashion. That kick earned Heiges a 10th place, All-American finish and MacMaster 11th place, both with times of 1:35:23. \r\nOnce the half marathon had cleared off the track, the sun broke out of the clouds and the 800m finals began. Maddie Mandich completed the toughest schedule of any UMD athlete by completing a quadruple of 5k, 4x8, 1500, and 800. Mandich would run 2:46, improving on her 4x8 split from a day before by nearly 10 seconds. A couple heats later, Mandich’s 4x8 teammate Kate Eckart was back on the track in the fastest heat, where she blazed out a first 400m in 70 seconds before making several key passes on the final 200m, finishing in 2:25. Uncertainty permeated the air as the teams awaited results, as a few runners from the second fastest heat finished awfully close to the finishers in the fastest heat. However, it soon became clear that Eckart’s final kick had paid off; she placed 8th and earned her second All-American award of the weekend.\r\nLone wolf Matt Stasiukevicius was eager to show off his range after his monstrous 5k PR on Saturday, and it became apparent that nobody else on the team was. UMD fans waited through nine heats of 800’s before Stas graced them with an impressive show of speed for a 5k runner, splitting just below 60 seconds for the first lap and rounding out the finish in 2:04.\r\nFinally, after a short day of track competition, UMD’s final race of the day arrived in the form of Katrina Hrabinski’s 3k steeplechase. Choosing to forego the 800m, Hrabinski walked into the finals as fresh as anyone could be after two hard races the day before. Hrabinski was racing the event for only the second time in her college career, and she employed a unique “heel-clicking” steeple form to battle it out with two Michigan competitors before sealing her second All-American finish of the weekend in a new club record of 12:12, good for 5th place. While spectators were forced to wait an extra hour for Hrabinski’s award to be given out, I think there can be disagreement that the wait was well worth it. Sayonara, clipboard number 9!\r\nUMD Club Running pulled up to Miami of Ohio at 7:30AM on a Saturday morning. Two days later, they left with a four new club records (two from Macmaster, one from Flint, and one from Hrabinski), two national champions, twelve All-American awards, three separate features on NIRCA’s Instagram story, twelve confirmed lifetime PR’s, two newly mute coaches, zero Tinder matches, and notably, without the ability to simultaneously have nine people write things down against a portable firm surface whilst standing up.

(349, 33, '2019-04-15 02:11:30', '2019-04-15 06:11:30', '<h3>Day 1: Courage, Camaraderie, and Clipboards</h3>\n7 years ago, a plucky organization of volunteers who had previously planned nothing but half marathons and other road races decided that it was time to expand their race repertoire to better serve the college runners that frequented their races. What they planned next was the first rendition of the NIRCA Spring Track Championships, including only a half marathon, a select few distance and sprint events, and excluding all field events. Over the years it has grown, improved, and morphed alongside college club running culture into the gorgeous and eclectic extravaganza full of elite caliber athletes, dedicated running junkies, and absurdist meme lords. It is this alternate universe that UMD Club Running entered as four rental vans, fresh with a coating of Indiana highway dust, pulled into the parking lot of the track the University of Miami of Ohio. Fueled by a burning desire to compete, coasting off the strength of months of consistent training, and motivated by a coaching staff of broke boiz Ryun Anderson and myself (who entered the meet armed with 9 clipboards primed for smashing in celebration/frustration), UMD Club athletes pit themselves against club athletes from all over the country.\n\nTrack action got off to a quick start in the 100m prelims, with Ian Lynch finishing in 13.44s and Kareem McDavid in 11.98s. Onlookers sat amazed not only at the performances, but at the fervor with which UMD Club athletes cheered on the “Kareem of the Crop,” specifically with how they continuously smashed a clipboard on a fence, trying to break it in celebration. One NIRCA representative even praised the team’s spirit, stating “Yeah, don’t do that.” Inspired by this feedback, Treasurer Brian McCullough responded by severing the first clipboard of the day with his knee, technically heeding the advice of the NIRCA representative. Immediately following the 100m dash, lone hurdler Dylan Briske began his triple event weekend with a 1:10.58s finish, where he miraculously did not have to jump over his blocks as he finished this time.\n\nFans relocated themselves around the track to achieve maximum cheering volume for the next event: the women’s 5k. The first of two heats featured Maddie Mandich, who even-split her way to a season PR of 21:48, while only being minorly distracted by the pack of wild animals in UMD clothes willing her on with creative chants from the other side of the fence (earning UMD Club a feature on NIRCA’s Instagram story). Mandich’s time was almost a 70 second improvement from her time at the Terrapin Invite a week prior. The second (and final) heat of the women’s 5k featured the dynamic roommate duo of Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster. Heiges fought hard to a time of 20:26, while MacMaster pulled away from all but three runners, placing 4th for an All-American finish with an absolutely absurd time of 17:48, going under the previous club record by over 40 seconds and PR’ing by a similar amount. Onlookers sat dumbstruck by the performance, and some coaches and their assistants were so excited that they even destroyed their own clipboards (that’s 2 and 3 right there). MacMaster would immediately celebrate this performance by skipping the awards ceremony in favor of an extended cooldown.\n\nAttention turned back to the sprint squad, as McDavid and Lynch doubled back to run 23.72s and 26.83s respectively in the 200m dash, while Corey Townsend, well warmed up after driving back the hotel to grab his spikes, stepped on the track and laid down a 25.84s performance.\nJust as quickly as the they left the track, the women’s distance team returned to field a 4 x 800m relay composed of a doubling Heiges and Mandich and a fresh pair of 800 specialists: Kate Eckart and Katrina Hrabinski. Hrabinski executed a tactically flawless 2:25 lead-off leg, complete with a certifiably feral final 200m in which she passed 3 competitors and handed off in 4th place. Heiges held her ground well against competitors in the second leg with a 2:49, passing off to Mandich, who, even on tired legs, smashed out a 2:56. Eckart anchored the way home, making two key passes on her way to a 2:26, securing a 7th place finish for women’s 4 x 8 in 10:37, which incidentally ensured that every single female competitor from UMD earned an All-American award.\n\nAfter a couple boring sprint semifinals immediately following the 4x8’s (in which, I would like to point out, the winning men’s time was 7:49 holy moly), the stage was set for 2 hours of pure endurance, agony, and passion. Yes, it was time for a NIRCA Nats special: 6 heats of men’s 5ks, and luckily enough for UMD, we managed to have someone in each heat of the 5k. Don’t ever say we don’t have a wide pace range on this club. Teammates flooded the infield to shriek encouragement over every inch of the track.\nOur first competitor was Matt Sebsibe, who, emboldened by his first track 5k in spikes, ran a smart race from beginning to end, passing competitors the entire way, including one particularly bold pass that just so happened to end the life of the fourth clipboard of the day. Sebsibe would close the final 200m in 38s for a massive season PR of 18:28. Justin Turner entered his heat in his traditional modest fashion, and then proceeded to prove that he was actually hustling us the whole time, like that episode of Drake and Josh where Josh is really good at billiards. Good times. Stating that his “stretch-goal” for the race was a 17:40 due to lack of consistent training, Turner proceeded to chase the front pack for his first mile, which took him out in 5:24. While the pace may have waned as the race went on, the effort never did, and Turner proved that by shifting gears from 42 second 200’s to ~37 second 200’s in the final 600m, for a very near lifetime PR of 17:28, well past Turner’s stretch goal.\n\nHeat three was populated by two club veterans: Vice President San Dinger and Resident-Guy-Named-Briggs Briggs. In a show of pure NIRCA spirit, your very own VP charged out in the front and provoked the crowd for noise, “meming” his way through the first mile in 5:10. Briggs, as a change of pace, was not the meme of this race and took the more modest approach, even-splitting his first two miles. Singer would later pull away from the field alongside two other competitors to set a lifetime PR of 16:19 (though he could not defeat the heat winner, the grossly mis-seeded “grown-ass man,” Virginia Tech’s Harry Wood), while Briggs was narrowly edged out by the women’s 5k champion by about 7 seconds, running 17:09.\nHeat 4 marked the beginning of the year of the Matt, as freshmen duo Matt Laskowski and Matt Stasiukevicius duked it out with an incredibly deep field. Laskowski, a self-proclaimed “no-kick” kind of runner, poured his energy into the first two miles, hanging on to the lead pack to shoot for a quick time, while Stas tucked into the back of the field. At the end of mile two, Stas seemingly floated past the enormous field to take second place in a staggering PR of 15:46. Laskowski would follow soon behind in a huge PR of 16:06. The two would commemorate their PR’s with a two halves of deservedly smashed clipboard number 5. Heat 5 featured a notably hat-less Rylan Flint, who sat perfectly relaxed on the leaders for 2 miles. Flint executed a clever race strategy that carried him to a lifetime PR of 15:34, which also earned him a finish in the top 20.\n\nFinally, exhausted fans on the infield stepped up to their final challenge of the gauntlet: cheering on the fast heat of the men’s 5k, starring hometown hero Mitch Welter. Welter, who missed the entirety of his freshman and sophomore seasons of outdoor track due to nagging injuries, entered his first track championship with grand expectations. Excitement rode high for 8 laps as an enormous pack of about 20 runners stayed bunched in the front, each of them flirting with 15-flat pace. Welter positioned himself perfectly in front of a tidal wave of runners, sometimes even pushing up to challenge the leader himself. The paced certainly lagged a bit in the middle mile (if you can call 4:55 lagging) as leaders interchanged, and it wasn’t until about 4.5 laps to go when the pack at the front burst, giving way to a line of runners all battling for a podium spot. While fans watched on in uncertainty, Welter never faltered in the final mile, blowing by two competitors in the final lap in about 65 seconds to seal a 15:09 PR and a 6th place finish as an All-American. Fittingly, Welter’s 6th place finish doomed the 6th clipboard to same fate as its predecessors, and just like that, the long, tired days of 5k’s were finally over.\n\nDuring the endless storm of 5k’s, Briske had recovered from his stint as a hurdler and snuck in a 4.94m long jump performance. However, Briske’s day was far from over, as he stepped up alongside Townsend, Lynch, and McDavid in the men’s 4 x 100m. Excessive amounts of “salt” were reportedly pumped through McDavid’s veins as the UMD men’s 4 x 100m wrapped up the event with a ~67% handoff success rate. However, as any STEM student will tell you, 67% is typically a C+ with the curve, and everyone knows that C’s get degrees.\n\nThe long day was wrapped up with the 1500m. Mandich stepped up to complete a tough triple of 5k, 4x8, and 1500, as she savagely flexed on two girls before essentially erasing them from existence as she kicked past them, hitting a season PR of 5:55 despite the fatigue.\n\nMandich’s performance was followed by the loaded final heat of the women’s 1500m, which featured a star-studded squad of MacMaster, Hrabinski, and Eckart. MacMaster, a self-proclaimed “5k-runner,” glided to the front of that race alongside Penn State’s Suzanne Stein (last year’s 5k champ) and Purdue’s Lucy Hilarides (this year’s 5k champ, who ran 17:02 earlier and also destroyed Briggs’ will to exist). Up against seasoned competitors with such storied credentials, it seemed, at least to the fans, as though a third-place finish would be a perfectly reasonable for MacMaster.\nThat’s what made the subsequent events so utterly astonishing; MacMaster threw in a surge with 500m to go and hit the bell lap in the lead. UMD athletes scrambled in a frenzy around the infield to will her onwards, hoping to help her outlast the imminent kick of Hilarides and Stein.\n\nHowever, MacMaster’s lead on the two champs only grew, until about the 200m, when fans began to suspect that the kick simply wasn’t coming from the second and third runners. Indeed, MacMaster powered downed the final straightaway as UMD athletes screamed themselves hoarse to celebrate UMD Club Runnings’ second ever NIRCA National Champion (and first ever female one): Shannon MacMaster, 1500m, 4:44.13. MacMaster’s mark obliterated her own club record from a week prior by 4 seconds, and she was joined at the finish line by Hrabinski, who was narrowly edged out of 9th place in 5:02, and Eckart, who improved upon her previous PR by 2 seconds in 5:08. Coach Anderson, moved by his team’s effort and the history he had witnessed, blasted the seventh clipboard out of existence, and turned to focus on the final few races of the day.\n\nAfter a wildly successful race by the women, the excitement seemed to bleed into the first heat of the men’s 1500m. Comeback kid Nate Lieske was unfortunately foiled by the track officials, who controversially denied his God-given right to race in an oversized bunny mascot head that he purchased at Wal Mart a day prior. Nevertheless, Lieske proceeded to dazzle the crowd with his ceremonial handcrafted Jorts, as he laid out his first official track race as a UMD Club athlete in 5:08, sealing the last 50m whilst eating a carrot that he had in his pocket the while time. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner all doubled back after their 5k’s to run what Coach Anderson refers to as “literally everyone’s 1500,” complete with (1) an unnecessarily fast first lap, (2) an incredibly slow second lap, and (3), in the case of Turner specifically, “WHEEEEEELS” in the last 400m. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner finished in separate heats with times of 4:54, 4:35, and 4:33, all of them featuring some very pronounced acceleration in the final lap.\n\nThe absolute final race of the day belonged to McCullough, whose most pronounced exertion of the meet thus far had been smashing the team’s first clipboard. Hoping to score from the 2nd to fastest heat, McCullough shot off the line surrounded by a dense crowd of what could only be described as “mouth-breathers.” While inhibited slightly by the traffic surrounded him, McCullough reportedly channeled several spirits and attained Nirvana as he unleashed his kick in the final 300m, earning him a 13th place finish in 4:04.\n\nAfter some brief lunch in downtown Oxford, the team returned to quiet Connersville, Indiana, to rest up for the second day of Nationals competition.\n<h3>Day 2: The Biggest Storm that Never Happened</h3>\nNerves were tense on Saturday night, as the outlook on Sunday’s weather looked dismal: rain and thunderstorms from 8AM to 3PM, which incidentally, was exactly when the meet was scheduled to take place. NIRCA drafted contingency and cancellation plans for both the half marathon and the final track events of the weekend, and UMD Club Running did the same. In order to keep people out of the rain as much as possible, the team elected to shuffle the car assignments to send the car of half marathon runners to the meet on time, while allowing the rest of the team to sleep an extra two hours and keep out of the rain.\n\nThese plans, while thoughtful, proved overly cautious, as the storm shifted away from Oxford, leading to slight drizzles in the morning that soon gave way to completely clear skies. Half marathoners took advantage of this miraculous turn of events to bring even more hardware for the club. Spurred on by an unencumbered Mitch Welter, who furiously shuttled himself around the half marathon course to catch a glimpse of the race whilst blaring the Pokémon theme song, the seven half marathoners of UMD flew over Oxford hills before making a beeline back to the track for the finish.\n\nNot only did Adolfo Blassino win the first 400m of the race (which, in the end, is the part that matters), but Rylan Flint, rebounding off of a stellar 5k PR from Saturday, stunned the field and the spectators as he blazed back on to the track to win the race in 1:13:23 by over 20 seconds, making him the Club’s second NIRCA National Champion of the weekend and the third in history. While the reaction to the victory was certainly delayed, Flint’s performance was deemed too impressive to allow another clipboard to survive, and thus, clipboard number 8 met its end in emphatic fashion. Flint not only smashed the oldest record on the club record books (2007, incidentally the only record not from this decade) by over 2 minutes, but led the male half marathoners of UMD to a third place finish. Indeed, the half marathon was scored by taking the total time of the top three runners from each team, meaning that new All-American Brian McCullough (8th, 1:16:23) and VP Daniel Singer (27th, 1:21:52) helped earn a shiny new trophy for the Terps. Supporting them was Jack Reimer (42nd, 1:24:47) and Blassino (54th, 1:26:46).\n\nWhile not fielding enough runners to be scored as a team, ever-together pair Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster ran side by side for the entire race, with Heiges kicking past MacMaster in the final 100m in thrilling fashion. That kick earned Heiges a 10th place, All-American finish and MacMaster 11th place, both with times of 1:35:23.\n\nOnce the half marathon had cleared off the track, the sun broke out of the clouds and the 800m finals began. Maddie Mandich completed the toughest schedule of any UMD athlete by completing a quadruple of 5k, 4x8, 1500, and 800. Mandich would run 2:46, improving on her 4x8 split from a day before by nearly 10 seconds. A couple heats later, Mandich’s 4x8 teammate Kate Eckart was back on the track in the fastest heat, where she blazed out a first 400m in 70 seconds before making several key passes on the final 200m, finishing in 2:25. Uncertainty permeated the air as the teams awaited results, as a few runners from the second fastest heat finished awfully close to the finishers in the fastest heat. However, it soon became clear that Eckart’s final kick had paid off; she placed 8th and earned her second All-American award of the weekend.\n\nLone wolf Matt Stasiukevicius was eager to show off his range after his monstrous 5k PR on Saturday, and it became apparent that nobody else on the team was. UMD fans waited through nine heats of 800’s before Stas graced them with an impressive show of speed for a 5k runner, splitting just below 60 seconds for the first lap and rounding out the finish in 2:04.\nFinally, after a short day of track competition, UMD’s final race of the day arrived in the form of Katrina Hrabinski’s 3k steeplechase. Choosing to forego the 800m, Hrabinski walked into the finals as fresh as anyone could be after two hard races the day before. Hrabinski was racing the event for only the second time in her college career, and she employed a unique “heel-clicking” steeple form to battle it out with two Michigan competitors before sealing her second All-American finish of the weekend in a new club record of 12:12, good for 5th place. While spectators were forced to wait an extra hour for Hrabinski’s award to be given out, I think there can be disagreement that the wait was well worth it. Sayonara, clipboard number 9!\n\nUMD Club Running pulled up to Miami of Ohio at 7:30AM on a Saturday morning. Two days later, they left with a four new club records (two from Macmaster, one from Flint, and one from Hrabinski), two national champions, twelve All-American awards, three separate features on NIRCA’s Instagram story, twelve confirmed lifetime PR’s, two newly mute coaches, zero Tinder matches, and notably, without the ability to simultaneously have nine people write things down against a portable firm surface whilst standing up. However, while NIRCA Nationals is always a season highlight, the season is far from over.

Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner all doubled back after their 5k’s to run what Coach Anderson refers to as “literally everyone’s 1500,” complete with (1) an unnecessarily fast first lap, (2) an incredibly slow second lap, and (3), in the case of Turner specifically, “WHEEEEEELS” in the last 400m. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner finished in separate heats with times of 4:54, 4:35, and 4:33, all of them featuring some very pronounced acceleration in the final lap.\n\nThe absolute final race of the day belonged to McCullough, whose most pronounced exertion of the meet thus far had been smashing the team’s first clipboard. Hoping to score from the 2nd to fastest heat, McCullough shot off the line surrounded by a dense crowd of what could only be described as “mouth-breathers.” While inhibited slightly by the traffic surrounded him, McCullough reportedly channeled several spirits and attained Nirvana as he unleashed his kick in the final 300m, earning him a 13th place finish in 4:04.\n\nAfter some brief lunch in downtown Oxford, the team returned to quiet Connersville, Indiana, to rest up for the second day of Nationals competition.\n<h3>Day 2: The Biggest Storm that Never Happened</h3>\nNerves were tense on Saturday night, as the outlook on Sunday’s weather looked dismal: rain and thunderstorms from 8AM to 3PM, which incidentally, was exactly when the meet was scheduled to take place. NIRCA drafted contingency and cancellation plans for both the half marathon and the final track events of the weekend, and UMD Club Running did the same. In order to keep people out of the rain as much as possible, the team elected to shuffle the car assignments to send the car of half marathon runners to the meet on time, while allowing the rest of the team to sleep an extra two hours and keep out of the rain.\n\nThese plans, while thoughtful, proved overly cautious, as the storm shifted away from Oxford, leading to slight drizzles in the morning that soon gave way to completely clear skies. Half marathoners took advantage of this miraculous turn of events to bring even more hardware for the club. Spurred on by an unencumbered Mitch Welter, who furiously shuttled himself around the half marathon course to catch a glimpse of the race whilst blaring the Pokémon theme song, the seven half marathoners of UMD flew over Oxford hills before making a beeline back to the track for the finish.\n\nNot only did Adolfo Blassino win the first 400m of the race (which, in the end, is the part that matters), but Rylan Flint, rebounding off of a stellar 5k PR from Saturday, stunned the field and the spectators as he blazed back on to the track to win the race in 1:13:23 by over 20 seconds, making him the Club’s second NIRCA National Champion of the weekend and the third in history. While the reaction to the victory was certainly delayed, Flint’s performance was deemed too impressive to allow another clipboard to survive, and thus, clipboard number 8 met its end in emphatic fashion. Flint not only smashed the oldest record on the club record books (2007, incidentally the only record not from this decade) by over 2 minutes, but led the male half marathoners of UMD to a third place finish. Indeed, the half marathon was scored by taking the total time of the top three runners from each team, meaning that new All-American Brian McCullough (8th, 1:16:23) and VP Daniel Singer (27th, 1:21:52) helped earn a shiny new trophy for the Terps. Supporting them was Jack Reimer (42nd, 1:24:47) and Blassino (54th, 1:26:46).\n\nWhile not fielding enough runners to be scored as a team, ever-together pair Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster ran side by side for the entire race, with Heiges kicking past MacMaster in the final 100m in thrilling fashion. That kick earned Heiges a 10th place, All-American finish and MacMaster 11th place, both with times of 1:35:23.\n\nOnce the half marathon had cleared off the track, the sun broke out of the clouds and the 800m finals began. Maddie Mandich completed the toughest schedule of any UMD athlete by completing a quadruple of 5k, 4x8, 1500, and 800. Mandich would run 2:46, improving on her 4x8 split from a day before by nearly 10 seconds. A couple heats later, Mandich’s 4x8 teammate Kate Eckart was back on the track in the fastest heat, where she blazed out a first 400m in 70 seconds before making several key passes on the final 200m, finishing in 2:25. Uncertainty permeated the air as the teams awaited results, as a few runners from the second fastest heat finished awfully close to the finishers in the fastest heat. However, it soon became clear that Eckart’s final kick had paid off; she placed 8th and earned her second All-American award of the weekend.\n\nLone wolf Matt Stasiukevicius was eager to show off his range after his monstrous 5k PR on Saturday, and it became apparent that nobody else on the team was. UMD fans waited through nine heats of 800’s before Stas graced them with an impressive show of speed for a 5k runner, splitting just below 60 seconds for the first lap and rounding out the finish in 2:04.\nFinally, after a short day of track competition, UMD’s final race of the day arrived in the form of Katrina Hrabinski’s 3k steeplechase. Choosing to forego the 800m, Hrabinski walked into the finals as fresh as anyone could be after two hard races the day before. Hrabinski was racing the event for only the second time in her college career, and she employed a unique “heel-clicking” steeple form to battle it out with two Michigan competitors before sealing her second All-American finish of the weekend in a new club record of 12:12, good for 5th place. While spectators were forced to wait an extra hour for Hrabinski’s award to be given out, I think there can be disagreement that the wait was well worth it.

(352, 33, '2019-04-15 14:09:12', '2019-04-15 18:09:12', '<h3>Day 1: Courage, Camaraderie, and Clipboards</h3>\n7 years ago, a plucky organization of volunteers who had previously planned nothing but half marathons and other road races decided that it was time to expand their race repertoire to better serve the college runners that frequented their races. What they planned next was the first rendition of the NIRCA Spring Track Championships, including only a half marathon, a select few distance and sprint events, and excluding all field events. Over the years it has grown, improved, and morphed alongside college club running culture into the gorgeous and eclectic extravaganza full of elite caliber athletes, dedicated running junkies, and absurdist meme lords. It is this alternate universe that UMD Club Running entered as four rental vans, fresh with a coating of Indiana highway dust, pulled into the parking lot of the track the University of Miami of Ohio. Fueled by a burning desire to compete, coasting off the strength of months of consistent training, and motivated by a coaching staff of broke boiz Ryun Anderson and myself (who entered the meet armed with 9 clipboards primed for smashing in celebration/frustration), UMD Club athletes pit themselves against club athletes from all over the country.\n\nTrack action got off to a quick start in the 100m prelims, with Ian Lynch finishing in 13.44s and Kareem McDavid in 11.98s. Onlookers sat amazed not only at the performances, but at the fervor with which UMD Club athletes cheered on the “Kareem of the Crop,” specifically with how they continuously smashed a clipboard on a fence, trying to break it in celebration. One NIRCA representative even praised the team’s spirit, stating “Yeah, don’t do that.” Inspired by this feedback, Treasurer Brian McCullough responded by severing the first clipboard of the day with his knee, technically heeding the advice of the NIRCA representative. Immediately following the 100m dash, lone hurdler Dylan Briske began his triple event weekend with a 1:10.58s finish, where he miraculously did not have to jump over his blocks as he finished this time.\n\nFans relocated themselves around the track to achieve maximum cheering volume for the next event: the women’s 5k. The first of two heats featured Maddie Mandich, who even-split her way to a season PR of 21:48, while only being minorly distracted by the pack of wild animals in UMD clothes willing her on with creative chants from the other side of the fence (earning UMD Club a feature on NIRCA’s Instagram story). Mandich’s time was almost a 70 second improvement from her time at the Terrapin Invite a week prior. The second (and final) heat of the women’s 5k featured the dynamic roommate duo of Julia Heiges and Shannon MacMaster. Heiges fought hard to a time of 20:26, while MacMaster pulled away from all but three runners, placing 4th for an All-American finish with an absolutely absurd time of 17:48, going under the previous club record by over 40 seconds and PR’ing by a similar amount. Onlookers sat dumbstruck by the performance, and some coaches and their assistants were so excited that they even destroyed their own clipboards (that’s 2 and 3 right there). MacMaster would immediately celebrate this performance by skipping the awards ceremony in favor of an extended cooldown.\n\nAttention turned back to the sprint squad, as McDavid and Lynch doubled back to run 23.72s and 26.83s respectively in the 200m dash, while Corey Townsend, well warmed up after driving back the hotel to grab his spikes, stepped on the track and laid down a 25.84s performance.\n\nJust as quickly as the they left the track, the women’s distance team returned to field a 4 x 800m relay composed of a doubling Heiges and Mandich and a fresh pair of 800 specialists: Kate Eckart and Katrina Hrabinski. Hrabinski executed a tactically flawless 2:25 lead-off leg, complete with a certifiably feral final 200m in which she passed 3 competitors and handed off in 4th place. Heiges held her ground well against competitors in the second leg with a 2:49, passing off to Mandich, who, even on tired legs, smashed out a 2:56. Eckart anchored the way home, making two key passes on her way to a 2:26, securing a 7th place finish for women’s 4 x 8 in 10:37, which incidentally ensured that every single female competitor from UMD earned an All-American award.\n\nAfter a couple boring sprint semifinals immediately following the 4x8’s (in which, I would like to point out, the winning men’s time was 7:49 holy moly), the stage was set for 2 hours of pure endurance, agony, and passion. Yes, it was time for a NIRCA Nats special: 6 heats of men’s 5ks, and luckily enough for UMD, we managed to have someone in each heat of the 5k. Don’t ever say we don’t have a wide pace range on this club. Teammates flooded the infield to shriek encouragement over every inch of the track.\n\nOur first competitor was Matt Sebsibe, who, emboldened by his first track 5k in spikes, ran a smart race from beginning to end, passing competitors the entire way, including one particularly bold pass that just so happened to end the life of the fourth clipboard of the day. Sebsibe would close the final 200m in 38s for a massive season PR of 18:28. Justin Turner entered his heat in his traditional modest fashion, and then proceeded to prove that he was actually hustling us the whole time, like that episode of Drake and Josh where Josh is really good at billiards. Good times. Stating that his “stretch-goal” for the race was a 17:40 due to lack of consistent training, Turner proceeded to chase the front pack for his first mile, which took him out in 5:24. While the pace may have waned as the race went on, the effort never did, and Turner proved that by shifting gears from 42 second 200’s to ~37 second 200’s in the final 600m, for a very near lifetime PR of 17:28, well past Turner’s stretch goal.\n\nHeat three was populated by two club veterans: Vice President San Dinger and Resident-Guy-Named-Briggs Briggs. In a show of pure NIRCA spirit, your very own VP charged out in the front and provoked the crowd for noise, “meming” his way through the first mile in 5:10. Briggs, as a change of pace, was not the meme of this race and took the more modest approach, even-splitting his first two miles. Singer would later pull away from the field alongside two other competitors to set a lifetime PR of 16:19 (though he could not defeat the heat winner, the grossly mis-seeded “grown-ass man,” Virginia Tech’s Harry Wood), while Briggs was narrowly edged out by the women’s 5k champion by about 7 seconds, running 17:09.\n\nHeat 4 marked the beginning of the year of the Matt, as freshmen duo Matt Laskowski and Matt Stasiukevicius duked it out with an incredibly deep field. Laskowski, a self-proclaimed “no-kick” kind of runner, poured his energy into the first two miles, hanging on to the lead pack to shoot for a quick time, while Stas tucked into the back of the field. At the end of mile two, Stas seemingly floated past the enormous field to take second place in a staggering PR of 15:46. Laskowski would follow soon behind in a huge PR of 16:06. The two would commemorate their PR’s with a two halves of deservedly smashed clipboard number 5. Heat 5 featured a notably hat-less Rylan Flint, who sat perfectly relaxed on the leaders for 2 miles. Flint executed a clever race strategy that carried him to a lifetime PR of 15:34, which also earned him a finish in the top 20.\n\nFinally, exhausted fans on the infield stepped up to their final challenge of the gauntlet: cheering on the fast heat of the men’s 5k, starring hometown hero Mitch Welter. Welter, who missed the entirety of his freshman and sophomore seasons of outdoor track due to nagging injuries, entered his first track championship with grand expectations. Excitement rode high for 8 laps as an enormous pack of about 20 runners stayed bunched in the front, each of them flirting with 15-flat pace. Welter positioned himself perfectly in front of a tidal wave of runners, sometimes even pushing up to challenge the leader himself. The paced certainly lagged a bit in the middle mile (if you can call 4:55 lagging) as leaders interchanged, and it wasn’t until about 4.5 laps to go when the pack at the front burst, giving way to a line of runners all battling for a podium spot. While fans watched on in uncertainty, Welter never faltered in the final mile, blowing by two competitors in the final lap in about 65 seconds to seal a 15:09 PR and a 6th place finish as an All-American. Fittingly, Welter’s 6th place finish doomed the 6th clipboard to same fate as its predecessors, and just like that, the long, tired days of 5k’s were finally over.\n\nDuring the endless storm of 5k’s, Briske had recovered from his stint as a hurdler and snuck in a 4.94m long jump performance. However, Briske’s day was far from over, as he stepped up alongside Townsend, Lynch, and McDavid in the men’s 4 x 100m. Excessive amounts of “salt” were reportedly pumped through McDavid’s veins as the UMD men’s 4 x 100m wrapped up the event with a ~67% handoff success rate. However, as any STEM student will tell you, 67% is typically a C+ with the curve, and everyone knows that C’s get degrees.\n\nThe long day was wrapped up with the 1500m. Mandich stepped up to complete a tough triple of 5k, 4x8, and 1500, as she savagely flexed on two girls before essentially erasing them from existence as she kicked past them, hitting a season PR of 5:55 despite the fatigue.\n\nMandich’s performance was followed by the loaded final heat of the women’s 1500m, which featured a star-studded squad of MacMaster, Hrabinski, and Eckart. MacMaster, a self-proclaimed “5k-runner,” glided to the front of that race alongside Penn State’s Suzanne Stein (last year’s 5k champ) and Purdue’s Lucy Hilarides (this year’s 5k champ, who ran 17:02 earlier and also destroyed Briggs’ will to exist). Up against seasoned competitors with such storied credentials, it seemed, at least to the fans, as though a third-place finish would be a perfectly reasonable for MacMaster.\nThat’s what made the subsequent events so utterly astonishing; MacMaster threw in a surge with 500m to go and hit the bell lap in the lead. UMD athletes scrambled in a frenzy around the infield to will her onwards, hoping to help her outlast the imminent kick of Hilarides and Stein.\n\nHowever, MacMaster’s lead on the two champs only grew, until about the 200m, when fans began to suspect that the kick simply wasn’t coming from the second and third runners. Indeed, MacMaster powered downed the final straightaway as UMD athletes screamed themselves hoarse to celebrate UMD Club Runnings’ second ever NIRCA National Champion (and first ever female one): Shannon MacMaster, 1500m, 4:44.13. MacMaster’s mark obliterated her own club record from a week prior by 4 seconds, and she was joined at the finish line by Hrabinski, who was narrowly edged out of 9th place in 5:02, and Eckart, who improved upon her previous PR by 2 seconds in 5:08. Coach Anderson, moved by his team’s effort and the history he had witnessed, blasted the seventh clipboard out of existence, and turned to focus on the final few races of the day.\n\nAfter a wildly successful race by the women, the excitement seemed to bleed into the first heat of the men’s 1500m. Comeback kid Nate Lieske was unfortunately foiled by the track officials, who controversially denied his God-given right to race in an oversized bunny mascot head that he purchased at Wal Mart a day prior. Nevertheless, Lieske proceeded to dazzle the crowd with his ceremonial handcrafted Jorts, as he laid out his first official track race as a UMD Club athlete in 5:08, sealing the last 50m whilst eating a carrot that he had in his pocket the while time. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner all doubled back after their 5k’s to run what Coach Anderson refers to as “literally everyone’s 1500,” complete with (1) an unnecessarily fast first lap, (2) an incredibly slow second lap, and (3), in the case of Turner specifically, “WHEEEEEELS” in the last 400m. Sebsibe, Briggs, and Turner finished in separate heats with times of 4:54, 4:35, and 4:33, all of them featuring some very pronounced acceleration in the final lap.\n\nThe absolute final race of the day belonged to McCullough, whose most pronounced exertion of the meet thus far had been smashing the team’s first clipboard. Hoping to score from the 2nd to fastest heat, McCullough shot off the line surrounded by a dense crowd of what could only be described as “mouth-breathers.” While inhibited slightly by the traffic surrounded him, McCullough reportedly channeled several spirits and attained Nirvana as he unleashed his kick in the final 300m, earning him a 13th place finish in 4:04.\n\nAfter some brief lunch in downtown Oxford, the team returned to quiet Connersville, Indiana, to rest up for the second day of Nationals competition.\n<h3>Day 2: The Biggest Storm that Never Happened</h3>\nNerves were tense on Saturday night, as the outlook on Sunday’s weather looked dismal: rain and thunderstorms from 8AM to 3PM, which incidentally, was exactly when the meet was scheduled to take place.

She came through the 5k at 19:45 (having only broken 20 minutes in the event two weeks earlier) and held on for a solid 40:35 finish, practically <em>daring</em> any girl on the club to try and break her newfound club record.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily the rain let up at the end\nof the 10k, and as the weather began to heat up, so did the times.

Despite being the webmaster for several years, designing the entire blog, and encouraging people to post all their stories on it, I never actually posted a real blog post myself. I figured I would come up with something funny to write up and post sometime, but as the quality and effort put into blog posts increased (<em>Yes Colin I’m looking at you for last season’s essay that kept me up until 2am the night before the Philly Marathon</em>) I realized I would have to write about something very meaningful. I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less! Buckle up for a legendary tale about pain, more pain, disappointment, misery, and sweet redemption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Beginning of an Obsession</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ever since I started racing the 5k my sophomore year, there has been one thing that has constantly eluded me despite training as hard as I could and trying to put myself in a position to succeed. That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of the Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this part. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . . Lastly your\nrunning economy is that of an elite middle and long distance runners, so I\nwould definitely be encouraged by that. It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year. It was just a question of how far under 17 I\ncould go. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 13<sup>th</sup>:\n2x(2x1000I with 400 jog, 2x400R with 200 jog, 200F with 600 jog)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite possibly my best work out of the semester and it made me realize just how much potential I had for this track season.

I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational.

From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners.

He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere. Later in the day, Shannon had her moment of brilliant racing by winning\nthe 1500m title, to build on her earlier PR-smashing performance in the 5k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone on the team was going crazy and was so excited for all of these brilliant performances. Seeing all the clipboards being broken after each great race was truly amazing and I was so happy for everyone, but I somewhat selfishly wanted it for myself, for me to have my own broken clipboard. But I had absolutely wasted the chance of a lifetime to do it. I had absolutely wasted the chance to break that 17-minute barrier yet again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Afterwards in the hotel room that night, I couldn’t help but\nwonder: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“When is my moment going\nto come when I run the race of my life? Is it ever going to come?”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>One Last Chance</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After my forgettable performance at Nationals, I had lost absolutely\nall confidence in my ability to run a decent 5k and was almost at my absolute\nlowest point mentally. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that confidence I had from great VO2 max tests and mid-season\nworkouts? <em>Disappeared completely.</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That excitement and optimism for having a great race at the\nnext meet? <em>Gone. Replaced with fear of\nrunning a terrible race and failure.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the season I thought I would be running sub 16:30’s\neasily, but now I just desperately hoped for a 16:59 by any means. And to make matters\nworse, there was only one meet left where I planned on racing the 5k, the\nWidener Invitational.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a very light week of training, included only doing a\nsingle short tempo paced workout, I packed away my overnight bag on Friday\nafternoon, and proceeded to travel with a few other members of the team up to\nChester, PA, where I was either going to return with a triumphant victory, or\nsoul-crushing failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now normally, the Widener Invitational runs their 5k on late\nFriday afternoon, the day before the rest of their track events. But unfortunately,\nthere was a thunderstorm occurring in the region all afternoon Friday, so the\n5k was postponed until the end of the meet Saturday.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the bright side, I didn’t have to run in humid, non-ideal racing conditions. On the downside, I had to stay and watch the entire meet on Saturday with a steady nervousness about my impending 5k race. But I couldn\'t change any of it, so after a great night-before-a-race dinner of Buffalo Mac &amp; Cheese, I went to bed early in preparation for my race the next day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the duration of Saturday, I proceeded to watch hundreds of runners run great races and great times in their respective events, including multiple PR’s from almost all of our club’s runners. But with every race I just kept thinking to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Why can’t the 5k be\nright now? I just want this to be over with already.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But unfortunately, the 5k wasn’t for another 8 or 9 hours, giving me plenty of time to internally stress out, but giving me also plenty of time to contemplate my race strategy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would I stay with my conservative racing strategy and try to even or maybe negative split? <em>Well that’s what I tried to do at Nationals, and that race went terrible so maybe not</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe a super aggressive start around 5:10 pace so you can bank time for when you die on the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile like you always do? <em>Well that just sounds like a super stupid way to run a 5k. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually I decided I would just go out at 5:24 mile pace, try to bank a little time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile, and hang on for dear life that last 4 laps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as the rest of the club finished their events and got\nready to head back to College Park, they wished me good luck and bid Ryun and I\nfarewell. But as I was saying goodbye to Mitch, he gave me a piece of advice\nthat might’ve been the most important thing I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Just go out and race\nhard. Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27. A 41 second PR.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It Finally happened.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 2 years of failure, I had finally achieved my goal of sub\n17.

I figured I would come up with something funny to write up and post sometime, but as the quality and effort put into blog posts increased (<em>Yes Colin I’m looking at you for last season’s essay that kept me up until 2am the night before the Philly Marathon</em>) I realized I would have to write about something very meaningful. I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less! Buckle up for a legendary tale about pain, more pain, disappointment, misery, and sweet redemption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Beginning of an Obsession</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ever since I started racing the 5k my sophomore year, there has been one thing that has constantly eluded me despite training as hard as I could and trying to put myself in a position to succeed. That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of beer Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this chapter. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . . Lastly your\nrunning economy is that of an elite middle and long distance runners, so I\nwould definitely be encouraged by that. It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year. It was just a question of how far under 17 I\ncould go. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 13<sup>th</sup>:\n2x(2x1000I with 400 jog, 2x400R with 200 jog, 200F with 600 jog)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite possibly my best work out of the semester and it made me realize just how much potential I had for this track season. My Running2win entry for this workout sums up this workout almost perfectly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em> \"So far this season i\'ve been hitting really good times during workouts and have felt more in shape then I have probably ever felt during track season and this workout was one of those ones where everything just really clicked.<br> <br> Did 2x(2x1000 2x400 200) and split 3:16 3:14 68 71 31.5 3:15 3:13 69.9 71.7 31.6.

I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational. Everyone kept talking about how the UVA track has\na great atmosphere and usually results in some impressive races, so given my great\ntraining I knew I could run some fast times and surprise myself in a big way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And well, I guess I did surprise myself. But it was exactly\nthe opposite kind of surprise from what I wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As has been the trend in my running career, I started my\ntrack season by not just running poorly, but somehow running what might be the\n2 worst track races of my life. Its not a great feeling when you roll up to a track\nand feel 70-degree weather with no clouds in the sky after being used to\ntraining in rainy and cold conditions. But that’s what ended up happening and\nby the time the 5k came around, I did not feel good in the slightest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt exhausted during the warmup and knew it was going to be tough to run a fast time. But then all my doubts and fears were exacerbated when I watched Shannon run a 18:41 5k when she was definitely in sub-18 shape at the time. When I asked her how she felt out there, all she said is <em>“It’s so freaking hot out there</em>” and I couldn’t help but dread my upcoming race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time the race itself came around, I had calmed down\nsomewhat and was off and racing before I knew it. I just tried to do what I did\nfor every 5k that I race, just look for competition and work off them for as\nlong as possible. From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners. It would be understandable if you thought something like:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Wow Briggs is doing\ngreat right now! He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere. Later in the day, Shannon had her moment of brilliant racing by winning\nthe 1500m title, to build on her earlier PR-smashing performance in the 5k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone on the team was going crazy and was so excited for all of these brilliant performances. Seeing all the clipboards being broken after each great race was truly amazing and I was so happy for everyone, but I somewhat selfishly wanted it for myself, for me to have my own broken clipboard. But I had absolutely wasted the chance of a lifetime to do it. I had absolutely wasted the chance to break that 17-minute barrier yet again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Afterwards in the hotel room that night, I couldn’t help but\nwonder: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“When is my moment going\nto come when I run the race of my life?

And to make matters\nworse, there was only one meet left where I planned on racing the 5k, the\nWidener Invitational.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a very light week of training, included only doing a\nsingle short tempo paced workout, I packed away my overnight bag on Friday\nafternoon, and proceeded to travel with a few other members of the team up to\nChester, PA, where I was either going to return with a triumphant victory, or\nsoul-crushing failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now normally, the Widener Invitational runs their 5k on late\nFriday afternoon, the day before the rest of their track events. But unfortunately,\nthere was a thunderstorm occurring in the region all afternoon Friday, so the\n5k was postponed until the end of the meet Saturday.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the bright side, I didn’t have to run in humid, non-ideal racing conditions. On the downside, I had to stay and watch the entire meet on Saturday with a steady nervousness about my impending 5k race. But I couldn\'t change any of it, so after a great night-before-a-race dinner of Buffalo Mac &amp; Cheese and 3 beers, including one forgettable \"light\" beer from Rhode Island, I went to bed early in preparation for my race the next day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the duration of Saturday, I proceeded to watch hundreds of runners run great races and great times in their respective events, including multiple PR’s from almost all of our club’s runners. But with every race I just kept thinking to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Why can’t the 5k be\nright now? I just want this to be over with already.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But unfortunately, the 5k wasn’t for another 8 or 9 hours, giving me plenty of time to internally stress out, but giving me also plenty of time to contemplate my race strategy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would I stay with my conservative racing strategy and try to even or maybe negative split? <em>Well that’s what I tried to do at Nationals, and that race went terrible so maybe not</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe a super aggressive start around 5:10 pace so you can bank time for when you die on the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile like you always do? <em>Well that just sounds like a super stupid way to run a 5k. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually I decided I would just go out at 5:24 mile pace, try to bank a little time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile, and hang on for dear life that last 4 laps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as the rest of the club finished their events and got\nready to head back to College Park, they wished me good luck and bid Ryun and I\nfarewell. But as I was saying goodbye to Mitch, he gave me a piece of advice\nthat might’ve been the most important thing I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Just go out and race\nhard. Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27 </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It Finally happened.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 2 years of failure, I had finally achieved my goal of sub\n17. I hadn’t just broken it by a little bit either, I had absolutely demolished\nthe barrier and went ahead and broke 16:30 as well. This was the race of my\nlife. This was my moment that I had been waiting for. I laid down on the track in\npure disbelief, as Ryun ran over with the same grin and disbelief I had, congratulating\nme and saying we had finally done it. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Meaning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the race, I was ecstatically happy.

I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less!

That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of beer Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this chapter. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . . Lastly your\nrunning economy is that of an elite middle and long distance runners, so I\nwould definitely be encouraged by that. It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year. It was just a question of how far under 17 I\ncould go. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 13<sup>th</sup>:\n2x(2x1000I with 400 jog, 2x400R with 200 jog, 200F with 600 jog)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite possibly my best work out of the semester and it made me realize just how much potential I had for this track season. My Running2win entry for this workout sums up this workout almost perfectly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em> \"So far this season i\'ve been hitting really good times during workouts and have felt more in shape then I have probably ever felt during track season and this workout was one of those ones where everything just really clicked.<br> <br> Did 2x(2x1000 2x400 200) and split 3:16 3:14 68 71 31.5 3:15 3:13 69.9 71.7 31.6. I started with Bill Ryan Laskowski and Jake but didn\'t think I would be able to keep with them the entire time.

Can\'t wait to start racing \'soon\'\"</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After all these workouts I was in such a great place mentally and had such an extraordinary amount of confidence in my fitness. I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational. Everyone kept talking about how the UVA track has\na great atmosphere and usually results in some impressive races, so given my great\ntraining I knew I could run some fast times and surprise myself in a big way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And well, I guess I did surprise myself. But it was exactly\nthe opposite kind of surprise from what I wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As has been the trend in my running career, I started my\ntrack season by not just running poorly, but somehow running what might be the\n2 worst track races of my life. Its not a great feeling when you roll up to a track\nand feel 70-degree weather with no clouds in the sky after being used to\ntraining in rainy and cold conditions. But that’s what ended up happening and\nby the time the 5k came around, I did not feel good in the slightest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt exhausted during the warmup and knew it was going to be tough to run a fast time. But then all my doubts and fears were exacerbated when I watched Shannon run a 18:41 5k when she was definitely in sub-18 shape at the time. When I asked her how she felt out there, all she said is <em>“It’s so freaking hot out there</em>” and I couldn’t help but dread my upcoming race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time the race itself came around, I had calmed down\nsomewhat and was off and racing before I knew it. I just tried to do what I did\nfor every 5k that I race, just look for competition and work off them for as\nlong as possible. From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners. It would be understandable if you thought something like:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Wow Briggs is doing\ngreat right now! He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere.

I just want this to be over with already.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But unfortunately, the 5k wasn’t for another 8 or 9 hours, giving me plenty of time to internally stress out, but giving me also plenty of time to contemplate my race strategy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would I stay with my conservative racing strategy and try to even or maybe negative split? <em>Well that’s what I tried to do at Nationals, and that race went terrible so maybe not</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe a super aggressive start around 5:10 pace so you can bank time for when you die on the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile like you always do? <em>Well that just sounds like a super stupid way to run a 5k. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually I decided I would just go out at 5:24 mile pace, try to bank a little time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile, and hang on for dear life that last 4 laps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as the rest of the club finished their events and got\nready to head back to College Park, they wished me good luck and bid Ryun and I\nfarewell. But as I was saying goodbye to Mitch, he gave me a piece of advice\nthat might’ve been the most important thing I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Just go out and race\nhard. Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27 </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It Finally happened.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 2 years of failure, I had finally achieved my goal of sub\n17. I hadn’t just broken it by a little bit either, I had absolutely demolished\nthe barrier and went ahead and broke 16:30 as well. This was the race of my\nlife. This was my moment that I had been waiting for. I laid down on the track in\npure disbelief, as Ryun ran over with the same grin and disbelief I had, congratulating\nme and saying we had finally done it. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Meaning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the race, I was ecstatically happy. I still couldn’t\nbelieve I had run that fast. I thought the best part of the day was finishing\nthe race, having broken the barrier that had cruelly taunted me for the past\ntwo years. But it turns out the best part was actually seeing the club’s\nreaction online when Ryun and I got back to the car and turned on my phone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Facebook chat had blown up, with so many congratulatory messages from so many different people. Apparently, Shannon had been stalking the live results ever lap of the race and leaked the news to everyone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had never seen such a huge reaction to a race, let alone a\nrace none of them were there to witness. If that wasn’t enough, the group chat\nname had been completely changed in my honor.

I figured I would come up with something funny to write up and post sometime, but as the quality and effort put into blog posts increased (<em>Yes Colin I’m looking at you for last season’s essay that kept me up until 2am the night before the Philly Marathon</em>) I realized I would have to write about something very meaningful. I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less!

That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of beer Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this part. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . .

It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year.

My Running2win entry for this workout sums up this workout almost perfectly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em> \"So far this season i\'ve been hitting really good times during workouts and have felt more in shape then I have probably ever felt during track season and this workout was one of those ones where everything just really clicked.<br> <br> Did 2x(2x1000 2x400 200) and split 3:16 3:14 68 71 31.5 3:15 3:13 69.9 71.7 31.6. I started with Bill Ryan Laskowski and Jake but didn\'t think I would be able to keep with them the entire time. But I was able to stick with them and I wasn\'t struggling to do so either. <br> <br> After the workout me and Laskowski were talking about how he was always way ahead of me during XC but now we are doing workouts together. Can\'t believe I\'ve improved that much in such a short time, but now I\'m definitely thinking sub 16:30 and low 4:20\'s for the 1500 this year. Can\'t wait to start racing \'soon\'\"</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After all these workouts I was in such a great place mentally and had such an extraordinary amount of confidence in my fitness. I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational. Everyone kept talking about how the UVA track has\na great atmosphere and usually results in some impressive races, so given my great\ntraining I knew I could run some fast times and surprise myself in a big way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And well, I guess I did surprise myself. But it was exactly\nthe opposite kind of surprise from what I wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As has been the trend in my running career, I started my\ntrack season by not just running poorly, but somehow running what might be the\n2 worst track races of my life. Its not a great feeling when you roll up to a track\nand feel 70-degree weather with no clouds in the sky after being used to\ntraining in rainy and cold conditions. But that’s what ended up happening and\nby the time the 5k came around, I did not feel good in the slightest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt exhausted during the warmup and knew it was going to be tough to run a fast time. But then all my doubts and fears were exacerbated when I watched Shannon run a 18:41 5k when she was definitely in sub-18 shape at the time. When I asked her how she felt out there, all she said is <em>“It’s so freaking hot out there</em>” and I couldn’t help but dread my upcoming race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time the race itself came around, I had calmed down\nsomewhat and was off and racing before I knew it. I just tried to do what I did\nfor every 5k that I race, just look for competition and work off them for as\nlong as possible. From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners. It would be understandable if you thought something like:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Wow Briggs is doing\ngreat right now! He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere. Later in the day, Shannon had her moment of brilliant racing by winning\nthe 1500m title, to build on her earlier PR-smashing performance in the 5k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone on the team was going crazy and was so excited for all of these brilliant performances. Seeing all the clipboards being broken after each great race was truly amazing and I was so happy for everyone, but I somewhat selfishly wanted it for myself, for me to have my own broken clipboard. But I had absolutely wasted the chance of a lifetime to do it. I had absolutely wasted the chance to break that 17-minute barrier yet again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Afterwards in the hotel room that night, I couldn’t help but\nwonder: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“When is my moment going\nto come when I run the race of my life? Is it ever going to come?”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>One Last Chance</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After my forgettable performance at Nationals, I had lost absolutely\nall confidence in my ability to run a decent 5k and was almost at my absolute\nlowest point mentally. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that confidence I had from great VO2 max tests and mid-season\nworkouts? <em>Disappeared completely.</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That excitement and optimism for having a great race at the\nnext meet? <em>Gone. Replaced with fear of\nrunning a terrible race and failure.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the season I thought I would be running sub 16:30’s\neasily, but now I just desperately hoped for a 16:59 by any means. And to make matters\nworse, there was only one meet left where I planned on racing the 5k, the\nWidener Invitational.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a very light week of training, included only doing a\nsingle short tempo paced workout, I packed away my overnight bag on Friday\nafternoon, and proceeded to travel with a few other members of the team up to\nChester, PA, where I was either going to return with a triumphant victory, or\nsoul-crushing failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now normally, the Widener Invitational runs their 5k on late\nFriday afternoon, the day before the rest of their track events. But unfortunately,\nthere was a thunderstorm occurring in the region all afternoon Friday, so the\n5k was postponed until the end of the meet Saturday.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the bright side, I didn’t have to run in humid, non-ideal racing conditions. On the downside, I had to stay and watch the entire meet on Saturday with a steady nervousness about my impending 5k race. But I couldn\'t change any of it, so after a great night-before-a-race dinner of Buffalo Mac &amp; Cheese and 3 beers, including one forgettable \"light\" beer from Rhode Island, I went to bed early in preparation for my race the next day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the duration of Saturday, I proceeded to watch hundreds of runners run great races and great times in their respective events, including multiple PR’s from almost all of our club’s runners. But with every race I just kept thinking to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Why can’t the 5k be\nright now? I just want this to be over with already.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But unfortunately, the 5k wasn’t for another 8 or 9 hours, giving me plenty of time to internally stress out, but giving me also plenty of time to contemplate my race strategy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would I stay with my conservative racing strategy and try to even or maybe negative split? <em>Well that’s what I tried to do at Nationals, and that race went terrible so maybe not</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe a super aggressive start around 5:10 pace so you can bank time for when you die on the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile like you always do? <em>Well that just sounds like a super stupid way to run a 5k. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually I decided I would just go out at 5:24 mile pace, try to bank a little time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile, and hang on for dear life that last 4 laps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as the rest of the club finished their events and got\nready to head back to College Park, they wished me good luck and bid Ryun and I\nfarewell. But as I was saying goodbye to Mitch, he gave me a piece of advice\nthat might’ve been the most important thing I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Just go out and race\nhard. Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27.

I figured I would come up with something funny to write up and post sometime, but as the quality and effort put into blog posts increased (<em>Yes Colin I’m looking at you for last season’s essay that kept me up until 2am the night before the Philly Marathon</em>) I realized I would have to write about something very meaningful. I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less!

That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of beer Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this part. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . . Lastly your\nrunning economy is that of an elite middle and long distance runners, so I\nwould definitely be encouraged by that. It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year. It was just a question of how far under 17 I\ncould go. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 13<sup>th</sup>:\n2x(2x1000I with 400 jog, 2x400R with 200 jog, 200F with 600 jog)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite possibly my best work out of the semester and it made me realize just how much potential I had for this track season. My Running2win entry for this workout sums up this workout almost perfectly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em> \"So far this season i\'ve been hitting really good times during workouts and have felt more in shape then I have probably ever felt during track season and this workout was one of those ones where everything just really clicked.<br> <br> Did 2x(2x1000 2x400 200) and split 3:16 3:14 68 71 31.5 3:15 3:13 69.9 71.7 31.6.

I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational. Everyone kept talking about how the UVA track has\na great atmosphere and usually results in some impressive races, so given my great\ntraining I knew I could run some fast times and surprise myself in a big way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And well, I guess I did surprise myself. But it was exactly\nthe opposite kind of surprise from what I wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As has been the trend in my running career, I started my\ntrack season by not just running poorly, but somehow running what might be the\n2 worst track races of my life. Its not a great feeling when you roll up to a track\nand feel 70-degree weather with no clouds in the sky after being used to\ntraining in rainy and cold conditions. But that’s what ended up happening and\nby the time the 5k came around, I did not feel good in the slightest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt exhausted during the warmup and knew it was going to be tough to run a fast time. But then all my doubts and fears were exacerbated when I watched Shannon run a 18:41 5k when she was definitely in sub-18 shape at the time. When I asked her how she felt out there, all she said is <em>“It’s so freaking hot out there</em>” and I couldn’t help but dread my upcoming race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time the race itself came around, I had calmed down\nsomewhat and was off and racing before I knew it. I just tried to do what I did\nfor every 5k that I race, just look for competition and work off them for as\nlong as possible. From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners. It would be understandable if you thought something like:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Wow Briggs is doing\ngreat right now! He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere. Later in the day, Shannon had her moment of brilliant racing by winning\nthe 1500m title, to build on her earlier PR-smashing performance in the 5k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone on the team was going crazy and was so excited for all of these brilliant performances. Seeing all the clipboards being broken after each great race was truly amazing and I was so happy for everyone, but I somewhat selfishly wanted it for myself, for me to have my own broken clipboard. But I had absolutely wasted the chance of a lifetime to do it. I had absolutely wasted the chance to break that 17-minute barrier yet again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Afterwards in the hotel room that night, I couldn’t help but\nwonder: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“When is my moment going\nto come when I run the race of my life? Is it ever going to come?”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>One Last Chance</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After my forgettable performance at Nationals, I had lost absolutely\nall confidence in my ability to run a decent 5k and was almost at my absolute\nlowest point mentally. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that confidence I had from great VO2 max tests and mid-season\nworkouts? <em>Disappeared completely.</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That excitement and optimism for having a great race at the\nnext meet? <em>Gone. Replaced with fear of\nrunning a terrible race and failure.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the season I thought I would be running sub 16:30’s\neasily, but now I just desperately hoped for a 16:59 by any means. And to make matters\nworse, there was only one meet left where I planned on racing the 5k, the\nWidener Invitational.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a very light week of training, included only doing a\nsingle short tempo paced workout, I packed away my overnight bag on Friday\nafternoon, and proceeded to travel with a few other members of the team up to\nChester, PA, where I was either going to return with a triumphant victory, or\nsoul-crushing failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now normally, the Widener Invitational runs their 5k on late\nFriday afternoon, the day before the rest of their track events. But unfortunately,\nthere was a thunderstorm occurring in the region all afternoon Friday, so the\n5k was postponed until the end of the meet Saturday.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the bright side, I didn’t have to run in humid, non-ideal racing conditions. On the downside, I had to stay and watch the entire meet on Saturday with a steady nervousness about my impending 5k race. But I couldn\'t change any of it, so after a great night-before-a-race dinner of Buffalo Mac &amp; Cheese and 3 beers, including one forgettable \"light\" beer from Rhode Island, I went to bed early in preparation for my race the next day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the duration of Saturday, I proceeded to watch hundreds of runners run great races and great times in their respective events, including multiple PR’s from almost all of our club’s runners. But with every race I just kept thinking to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Why can’t the 5k be\nright now? I just want this to be over with already.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But unfortunately, the 5k wasn’t for another 8 or 9 hours, giving me plenty of time to internally stress out, but giving me also plenty of time to contemplate my race strategy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would I stay with my conservative racing strategy and try to even or maybe negative split? <em>Well that’s what I tried to do at Nationals, and that race went terrible so maybe not</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe a super aggressive start around 5:10 pace so you can bank time for when you die on the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile like you always do? <em>Well that just sounds like a super stupid way to run a 5k. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually I decided I would just go out at 5:24 mile pace, try to bank a little time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile, and hang on for dear life that last 4 laps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as the rest of the club finished their events and got\nready to head back to College Park, they wished me good luck and bid Ryun and I\nfarewell. But as I was saying goodbye to Mitch, he gave me a piece of advice\nthat might’ve been the most important thing I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Just go out and race\nhard. Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27.

Despite being the webmaster for several years, designing the entire blog, and encouraging people to post all their stories on it, I never actually posted a real blog post myself. I figured I would come up with something funny to write up and post sometime, but as the quality and effort put into blog posts increased (<em>Yes Colin I’m looking at you for last season’s essay that kept me up until 2am the night before the Philly Marathon</em>) I realized I would have to write about something very meaningful. I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less! Buckle up for a legendary tale about pain, more pain, disappointment, misery, and sweet redemption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Beginning of an Obsession</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ever since I started racing the 5k my sophomore year, there has been one thing that has constantly eluded me despite training as hard as I could and trying to put myself in a position to succeed. That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of the Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this part. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . . Lastly your\nrunning economy is that of an elite middle and long distance runners, so I\nwould definitely be encouraged by that. It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year. It was just a question of how far under 17 I\ncould go. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 13<sup>th</sup>:\n2x(2x1000I with 400 jog, 2x400R with 200 jog, 200F with 600 jog)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite possibly my best work out of the semester and it made me realize just how much potential I had for this track season. My Running2win entry for this workout sums up this workout almost perfectly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em> \"So far this season i\'ve been hitting really good times during workouts and have felt more in shape then I have probably ever felt during track season and this workout was one of those ones where everything just really clicked.<br> <br> Did 2x(2x1000 2x400 200) and split 3:16 3:14 68 71 31.5 3:15 3:13 69.9 71.7 31.6.

I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational. Everyone kept talking about how the UVA track has\na great atmosphere and usually results in some impressive races, so given my great\ntraining I knew I could run some fast times and surprise myself in a big way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And well, I guess I did surprise myself. But it was exactly\nthe opposite kind of surprise from what I wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As has been the trend in my running career, I started my\ntrack season by not just running poorly, but somehow running what might be the\n2 worst track races of my life. Its not a great feeling when you roll up to a track\nand feel 70-degree weather with no clouds in the sky after being used to\ntraining in rainy and cold conditions. But that’s what ended up happening and\nby the time the 5k came around, I did not feel good in the slightest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt exhausted during the warmup and knew it was going to be tough to run a fast time. But then all my doubts and fears were exacerbated when I watched Shannon run a 18:41 5k when she was definitely in sub-18 shape at the time. When I asked her how she felt out there, all she said is <em>“It’s so freaking hot out there</em>” and I couldn’t help but dread my upcoming race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time the race itself came around, I had calmed down\nsomewhat and was off and racing before I knew it. I just tried to do what I did\nfor every 5k that I race, just look for competition and work off them for as\nlong as possible. From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners. It would be understandable if you thought something like:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Wow Briggs is doing\ngreat right now! He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere. Later in the day, Shannon had her moment of brilliant racing by winning\nthe 1500m title, to build on her earlier PR-smashing performance in the 5k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone on the team was going crazy and was so excited for all of these brilliant performances. Seeing all the clipboards being broken after each great race was truly amazing and I was so happy for everyone, but I somewhat selfishly wanted it for myself, for me to have my own broken clipboard. But I had absolutely wasted the chance of a lifetime to do it. I had absolutely wasted the chance to break that 17-minute barrier yet again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Afterwards in the hotel room that night, I couldn’t help but\nwonder: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“When is my moment going\nto come when I run the race of my life? Is it ever going to come?”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>One Last Chance</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After my forgettable performance at Nationals, I had lost absolutely\nall confidence in my ability to run a decent 5k and was almost at my absolute\nlowest point mentally. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that confidence I had from great VO2 max tests and mid-season\nworkouts? <em>Disappeared completely.</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That excitement and optimism for having a great race at the\nnext meet? <em>Gone. Replaced with fear of\nrunning a terrible race and failure.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the season I thought I would be running sub 16:30’s\neasily, but now I just desperately hoped for a 16:59 by any means. And to make matters\nworse, there was only one meet left where I planned on racing the 5k, the\nWidener Invitational.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a very light week of training, included only doing a\nsingle short tempo paced workout, I packed away my overnight bag on Friday\nafternoon, and proceeded to travel with a few other members of the team up to\nChester, PA, where I was either going to return with a triumphant victory, or\nsoul-crushing failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now normally, the Widener Invitational runs their 5k on late\nFriday afternoon, the day before the rest of their track events. But unfortunately,\nthere was a thunderstorm occurring in the region all afternoon Friday, so the\n5k was postponed until the end of the meet Saturday.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the bright side, I didn’t have to run in humid, non-ideal racing conditions. On the downside, I had to stay and watch the entire meet on Saturday with a steady nervousness about my impending 5k race. But I couldn\'t change any of it, so after a great night-before-a-race dinner of Buffalo Mac &amp; Cheese, I went to bed early in preparation for my race the next day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the duration of Saturday, I proceeded to watch hundreds of runners run great races and great times in their respective events, including multiple PR’s from almost all of our club’s runners. But with every race I just kept thinking to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Why can’t the 5k be\nright now? I just want this to be over with already.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But unfortunately, the 5k wasn’t for another 8 or 9 hours, giving me plenty of time to internally stress out, but giving me also plenty of time to contemplate my race strategy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would I stay with my conservative racing strategy and try to even or maybe negative split? <em>Well that’s what I tried to do at Nationals, and that race went terrible so maybe not</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe a super aggressive start around 5:10 pace so you can bank time for when you die on the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile like you always do? <em>Well that just sounds like a super stupid way to run a 5k. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually I decided I would just go out at 5:24 mile pace, try to bank a little time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> mile, and hang on for dear life that last 4 laps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as the rest of the club finished their events and got\nready to head back to College Park, they wished me good luck and bid Ryun and I\nfarewell. But as I was saying goodbye to Mitch, he gave me a piece of advice\nthat might’ve been the most important thing I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Just go out and race\nhard. Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27. A 41 second PR.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It Finally happened.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 2 years of failure, I had finally achieved my goal of sub\n17. I hadn’t just broken it by a little bit either, I had absolutely demolished\nthe barrier and went ahead and broke 16:30 as well. This was the race of my\nlife. This was my moment that I had been waiting for. I laid down on the track in\npure disbelief, as Ryun ran over with the same grin and disbelief I had, congratulating\nme and saying we had finally done it. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Meaning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the race, I was ecstatically happy.

I just had to wait for the right moment that I could write a post about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I think that special moment happened this past weekend, on 4/20 none the less!

That thing was a sub 17:00 5k. At the 2017 iteration of NIRCA Nats, I ran a 17:20, which was a solid time for my first 5k race but far from what I wanted to run. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t expecting an amazing time from that race anyways, as it was a day after running a great 1500 race, achieving a 4 second PR, and after my skin had made an impressive attempt to impersonate a tomato by getting terrible sunburn. But despite all of that, I was disappointed with time because I knew I could’ve gone faster. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast forward to my Junior year, you would think that after a year of hard, quality training I would be in way better shape and in a position to destroy my 5k times from a year prior right? <em>Nope</em>. <em>Not even close</em>. It was unfortunately more of the same unsatisfactory performances in the 5k, including a 17:22 at the Danny Curan Invitational and a miserable 18:04 at NIRCA Track Nats where I was not mentally engaged, and my legs felt like Nate’s shoulder after a night of the Olympics. I knew I was in better shape than I was my Sophomore year, and I was definitely more prepared to race the 5k, but for some reason my times weren’t showing any signs of improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, coming into this year with a PR of 17:20 in the 5k annoyed me a lot. I knew I was way faster than my 5k times indicated I was, I just needed to increase my mileage a little bit and just focus primarily on the 5k instead of the 1500m for one season. I knew it was my last season of track and I couldn’t let myself end my college running career without breaking 17 once. I <em>needed</em> to break 17 just so I could be content with myself and know I fulfilled my goals and didn’t leave anything unfinished or half done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I knew I could do it as well. Heck Hiro ran a 16:52 his\nfreshman year at NIRCA Nats, if I can’t run a 16:59 as a senior with a lot more\nexperience and mileage on his legs, then what does that say about me as a\nrunner? Additionally, after the debacle at Princeton Invitational during XC\nseason, I would not let Hiro have bragging rights in the 5k AND the 8k. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as 2019 began I began a new base training phase focused on solely increasing my weekly mileage to levels that I would be disgusted with my freshman year. I started by making my absolute shortest run 8 miles, which if you told the high school Briggs he would be doing that then he would probably laugh because he thought you were joking, shortly before he ran outside to go do a snow angel wearing nothing except running shorts. Slowly but surely, I began hitting 60 – 65 mile weeks and felt great while doing it. Usually, I don’t do high mileage weeks like this very consistently, but training for the marathon during XC season got my legs used to running longer, so it felt natural to keep increasing the mileage. There were runs where I felt like I could just keep running forever and I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wait, if I kept\nrunning at this pace I could probably run a Boston Qualifier Marathon during my\nlong run. Would Boston accept a Running2Win entry with appropriate GPS data as\nproof that I am worthy enough to subject myself to 26.2 miles of torture?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After coming to the sad realization that Boston would not recognize a bunch of random neighborhoods and streets in Gaithersburg as a Boston qualifying course, I just maintained the mileage going into the new semester with a renewed confidence in my fitness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Death of a Training Group</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh boy, I am not going to enjoy writing this part. With my goal of the sub 17:00 5k in mind, I knew I needed to start doing workouts in late January. So naturally I hit up my favorite training group partners of Shannon and Nate to do a 8 x 2 minutes hard 1 minute easy fartlek in the middle of a snowstorm. Now even though we were in the same training group, Shannon and I did end up spreading out during most of our workouts towards the end of XC season. However, I could always count on her to stick with me through the first rep, even if it was way too fast like it always was. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this workout was different. I put a decent gap between me and others by the end of the first rep (part of this was because Shannon dropped her key and stopped 100m in) and didn’t really feel like I was pushing too hard. Despite being alone for the rest of the workout, I kept up the pace and by 6<sup>th</sup> hard section I was about to lap Nate. I didn’t anticipate the gap being this large, but I was too excited about how fast I was going, or how fit I felt too care about running alone at this point. Nate and Shannon stopped around 5 or 6 reps and I went on to do the full 8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now this workout was significant for two reasons</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It really showed me my increased mileage was\npaying off and gave me a great amount of confidence going into the season</li><li>It was the last workout that Shannon Nate and I\nwould do together</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that 2<sup>nd</sup> reason is both a blessing and a\ncurse. On the bright side, I was getting a lot faster and it was a good sign\nthat I was going to be able to run great times in races this season. But getting\nfaster meant I wouldn’t be part of Shannon’s and Nate’s training group anymore.\nAnd that was really sad for me because I had some great workouts and fun memories\nwith them during cross country season. However, as a parting gift to my\nfavorite training group of all time, I decided to break Nate’s shoulder and\nsideline him with yet another injury, effectively breaking up my favorite\ntraining group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the next couple of weeks I would be a free agent on the\ntraining group market before settling into a new training group involving Rex,\nwho I hadn’t seen since the first day of club running practice my freshman\nyear, Laskowski, and brief appearances from Ryan Kapoor, Konrad, and even Bill\n(but only when the 5k workout was the same as the 800 workout). And with my new\ntraining group I began having some of the best workouts of my entire running\ncareer. There were a couple milestone workouts that I was particularly happy\nwith that I’ve highlighted below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 5<sup>th</sup>:\n5x1000m repeats with 200m jog </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the first workout I did with Rex and was just meant to get my legs ready for faster workouts since I haven’t really gone faster than tempo pace in a few months. A smart runner would’ve taken 400m jogging rest between reps, but I am an idiot and thought 200m would be enough. Despite the short rest, I got faster with each rep and split 3:32 3:29 3:27 3:25 3:23. This was amazing considering I was hitting low 3:30’s during the same workout in XC season (and I did this with half the rest I was supposed to have as well). It was especially impressive when you consider that I when I did this workout during XC, it was at the end of the season, but this time I did it even faster during the first few weeks of the semester. I knew I was doing something right and my training was looking like it was in a great spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>February 22<sup>nd</sup>:\n3.5 x 3 hard 1 easy 5 hard 2 easy fartlek</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This workout encapsulated pack running at its finest. I came\ninto the day still looking for a solid training group to join me and Rex on\nworkouts and found one at the very beginning of the workout. It was an absolute\n<em>squad</em> of Ryan Kapoor, Daniel Jordan,\nKonrad, Rex, and I just grinding away at this fartlek, exchanging leads every\nso often so nobody would be working too hard. I remember being in the back of\nthe pack at one point and just thinking to myself: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“What the heck is going\non? Am I really running a workout with dudes that have run a sub 2:00 800? Am I\nreally this fast now?”</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well apparently I was that fast because we were cruising and\nwere all together the entire way, motivating each other to keep up the pace on every\nrep. I haven’t really run in a pack like that during a workout ever in my life.\nEven in high school, to get a pack together like that during a workout meant a\ncouple people would have to slow down their workouts so others would have a\npack to run with. But here every single one of us was giving a hard effort and\nit worked perfectly. I gained even more confidence in my fitness and training\noff this workout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 4<sup>th</sup>:\nVo2 Max Test </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a Vo2 max\ntest entails, it is a essentially a 10 minute treadmill run at progressively\nincreasing speeds every 2 minutes. After a brief warmup, you begin the test\nrunning at approximately tempo pace, and every 2 minutes the speed increases by\n~2 km/hour (roughly 17 seconds/mile). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I had no idea why I was doing this test, but it sounded like a cool thing that could use to see how much faster I have gotten and if I was really in shape for the sub 17:00 5k. After my 3-minute warm-up at 7:00 pace I began my test at 6:00 mile pace, progressively speeding up until I finished my test with 2 minutes at roughly <em>4:58 mile pace??</em> Yeah, I was surprised when Jessica, the person conducting the test, told me how I was running at a pace 10 seconds slower than my mile PR pace for the last 2 minutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the real shock didn’t come until 3 weeks later when Jessica gave me all the data for my Vo2 max test. Coming into the test Bill, who is an all-knowing god when it comes to this kind of stuff, predicted I would be around a 65 for Vo2 Max, which would be way ahead of where I needed to be for a sub 17:00 5k. But when I sent over all my data to Bill to translate the numbers into something I would actually understand I was so thrilled with what he told me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Basically your VO2 is\n67 mL/kg/min. Your lactate threshold is about 61, so about 90% of your VO2 max.\nThat’s impressive and indicates that your highly trained. . . Lastly your\nrunning economy is that of an elite middle and long distance runners, so I\nwould definitely be encouraged by that. It seems like you’re really fit and\ngenetically capable of breaking 17”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boom. That surpassed my wildest expectations of anything I\ncould’ve learned from the test. The confidence boost from Bill comparing my\nrunning economy to that of Eliud Kipchoge gave me such a high that I had no\ndoubts I would break 17 this year. It was just a question of how far under 17 I\ncould go. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>March 13<sup>th</sup>:\n2x(2x1000I with 400 jog, 2x400R with 200 jog, 200F with 600 jog)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite possibly my best work out of the semester and it made me realize just how much potential I had for this track season. My Running2win entry for this workout sums up this workout almost perfectly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em> \"So far this season i\'ve been hitting really good times during workouts and have felt more in shape then I have probably ever felt during track season and this workout was one of those ones where everything just really clicked.<br> <br> Did 2x(2x1000 2x400 200) and split 3:16 3:14 68 71 31.5 3:15 3:13 69.9 71.7 31.6. I started with Bill Ryan Laskowski and Jake but didn\'t think I would be able to keep with them the entire time.

Can\'t wait to start racing \'soon\'\"</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After all these workouts I was in such a great place mentally and had such an extraordinary amount of confidence in my fitness. I was able to run longer during easy runs, my workouts were way faster than they were in the past, and I had peaked at 75 miles / week while consistently running 70 miles every other weak. I could practically taste the sub 17:00 5k at this point and I wasn’t even worried if it would happen. I <em>knew</em> that it was going to happen. I was so pumped to finally start racing after all these weeks of training and finally break that barrier that had taunted me for the past 2 years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Cavalier Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several weeks of high mileage, hard training, and the\nburning anticipation to race, it was finally here, my first race of the season\nat the Cavalier Invitational. Everyone kept talking about how the UVA track has\na great atmosphere and usually results in some impressive races, so given my great\ntraining I knew I could run some fast times and surprise myself in a big way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And well, I guess I did surprise myself. But it was exactly\nthe opposite kind of surprise from what I wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As has been the trend in my running career, I started my\ntrack season by not just running poorly, but somehow running what might be the\n2 worst track races of my life. Its not a great feeling when you roll up to a track\nand feel 70-degree weather with no clouds in the sky after being used to\ntraining in rainy and cold conditions. But that’s what ended up happening and\nby the time the 5k came around, I did not feel good in the slightest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt exhausted during the warmup and knew it was going to be tough to run a fast time. But then all my doubts and fears were exacerbated when I watched Shannon run a 18:41 5k when she was definitely in sub-18 shape at the time. When I asked her how she felt out there, all she said is <em>“It’s so freaking hot out there</em>” and I couldn’t help but dread my upcoming race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time the race itself came around, I had calmed down\nsomewhat and was off and racing before I knew it. I just tried to do what I did\nfor every 5k that I race, just look for competition and work off them for as\nlong as possible. From a spectator’s view you would think I was doing great,\nafter 4 laps around that track, I had just split a 5:20 1st mile and was in a\ndecent pack of 4 runners. It would be understandable if you thought something like:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<em>Wow Briggs is doing\ngreat right now! He might run really fast!”</em>&nbsp;\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all I was thinking was: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow I feel like shit right now. I’m actually about to die</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And die I surely did, dropping from the pack almost immediately after the first mile and slowing down enough to run a 17:51 5k. That’s a pretty bad time given the goals I had set for myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I wasn’t that discouraged by the race. Sure, I would’ve liked to run faster, but almost nobody ran a good time in the 5k. From Colin dropping out midway through the race, all the way to Stas running a 17:04, most of the times left a lot to be desired. It was just terrible conditions for an early season race, and I knew I could run faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a brief cool-down, I proceeded to follow up my poor performance in the 5k with an even worse performance in the open mile, by losing to Shannon AND Michael Hughes. As I did with the 5k, I just ignored these results and simply set my sights to the home meet coming up the next weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Terrapin Invitational</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eager to show that my races at UVA were just a fluke race and not a true indicator of my fitness, I signed up for my classic 5000m / 1500m double at our home meet. After a couple good workouts during the week and good weather coming in for Saturday’s meet, I was sure that I was going to run a great time. I wouldn’t have to sit a car driving for a couple hours before I raced, so my legs would be fresh, and Rex was running the 5k as well, so I would have someone to pace with the entire time. Literally nothing could go wrong, I was sure I was going to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, as usual, something went wrong. This time it was\nsolely on me being an idiot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first made my goal this season to run a sub 17:00 5k, I decided that I need to change a couple things in order to achieve it. The 1<sup>st</sup> thing was obviously my training, so I increased my mileage and started doing workouts faster. But the 2<sup>nd</sup> thing was more difficult, I decided to alter my strategy of how I ran the 5k.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, I wanted to go out more conservatively in the\n5k and try to even split it as much as possible. Up until this point, I had\ngone out way too fast in the 1<sup>st</sup> mile and flat out died the last 2\nmiles in every 5k I had raced. For this race, I decided to just try to pay\nattention to how I was feeling and not go out too hard in the first mile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My new racing strategy worked, for the first lap at least, as I ran a 80 and felt so smooth. But then as I came around the 2<sup>nd</sup> lap, I heard someone yelling out splits and I heard that I ran an 86 second lap. I briefly thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Wow an 86 is on pace\nfor 5:30 mile, right? That felt so easy, this is going great</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then the effects of the all dumb fuck juice I drank\nbefore the race began to wear off and I realized that and 86 second wasn’t even\nclose to 5:30 mile pace. <em>It was freaking\n5:44 pace. Snails can go faster than that. Briggs why are you going so slow??</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In hindsight, I should’ve realized I was going too slow way earlier because Rex had a good 30 – 40 meter lead on me 2 laps into the race and we were supposed to be running together. I just wasn’t mentally engaged enough to follow through on that. I proceed to pick the pace up and run 80’s for the next couple of laps until I got back on pace and caught up to Rex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Okay you messed up at\nthe beginning of the race but now you’re back on pace. That last mile was 5:26.\nPerfect. Just stay up here with Rex and we can work together and run a great\ntime.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as we neared the halfway point of the race, I felt us slowing down ever so slightly. I decided we needed to pick up the pace immediately if we wanted to keep 17:00 in reach, so I made a big move in hopes that Rex would realize what I was thinking and match my move.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>No luck</em>. I ran the\nrest of the race alone, struggling to maintain the pace as there was nobody\nahead of me that I could focus on catching or pacing off. With a couple laps to\ngo, I knew I was going too slow, but I didn’t realize how much I had slowed\ndown until 200m to go when I saw I had come through 3 miles in 16:30. I needed\na 30 second 200 to break 17? Yikes that probably wasn’t going to happen, but I\nkicked it in as hard as I could and finished with a time of 17:08. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was it sub 17:00? Nope. But it was a 12 second PR and after all my years of running I knew I had to take the small victories when they came. I was disappointed in how poorly I was mentally prepared in the early stages of the race, but I also knew that in a race with more competition, I probably could’ve stayed on pace and run a sub 17:00. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still had no major worries, as nationals was coming up the\nnext week and there would surely be enough quality competition there to push me\nunder the 17-minute barrier. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But nationals was next week, and I had to stay focused on the present. I still had to race the 1500m and could probably run a solid time in that, or so I thought. On dead legs, I proceeded to lose to Shannon AND Michael Hughes in the 1500m again. <em>At least I was consistent right?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Waiting for my Moment</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after a somewhat disappointed couple of races at the home meet, I refocused on getting in a couple of less strenuous, but quality workouts to make sure I was in peak condition for NIRCA Track Nationals coming up that weekend. But I could tell something in my body was off early in the week during an easy run through Greenbelt trails and I fell <em>way</em> back of the entire group midway through the run. The group probably had a solid 100 meters on me, and I felt like complete shit and was really contemplating just walking the dreadful 4 miles back to campus. But after a fortunately long traffic light stop, I was able to catch up and tell everyone how I’m going to slow down for the last couple miles because I don’t feel great. And thankfully Rylan replied with the most encouraging words you could possibly imagine:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>“Oh it looks like\nyou’re catching my cold Briggs!”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course. Thanks Rylan. But while I really wish he was\nwrong, I couldn’t really deny the fact that I was coming down with some form of\nsickness, whether it be Rylan’s cold, or a less intense strain of the plague\nthat nearly destroyed half the team during XC season. After finishing one of\nthe most miserable runs of the season and getting back to my apartment, I\nimmediately started taking Advil regularly in hopes of mitigating the illness\nbefore it got any worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With some mixed success, the illness didn\'t get worse and I felt good enough to finish my two workouts for that week at decent paces, but I still was worried about how much time my body would have to recover before Nationals that weekend. Thankfully, I felt much better on Friday than I had felt throughout the week and thought this would be the race weekend I have been waiting for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And just like that, Saturday morning arrived, and the conditions were beautiful with a cool temperature throughout the morning and clouds covering the entire sky. I knew these were the perfect conditions for fast times in the 5k and this was immediately confirmed when Lucy Hilrades of Purdue won the women’s race in a time of 17:02.74, absolutely destroying 2<sup>nd</sup> place and the meet record in the process. As if I needed any more motivation to run sub 17:00, now I knew I had to just so I could say I didn’t lose to a girl from Purdue. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the typical warm-up, agility drills, and watching Justin almost fall of the track several times during his 5k, I was ready to run and got on the line for my chance to break sub 17. The race started innocently enough, as I relaxed and let most of the others run ahead in a more aggressive start than I desired. I settled into a rhythm of running 82 seconds per 400 and just tried to find other competitors to pace off and run with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it turns out that it would be harder than I thought to pace off someone. Every time I made a move and caught another runner, they would instantly start slowing down, forcing me to pass and just focus on catching the next runner in hopes they would maintain the pace. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen as I kept making moves and passing runners who were dying for the first 8 laps of the race. But I still had Coach Sybing and the rest of the team cheering me on let me know that I was on perfect pace to run sub 17:00. I briefly thought to myself</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are perfect\nconditions, I’ve got a huge squad cheering me on, and I’m on pace through 2\nmiles. What more could I ask for? This is it. Today is the day for sub 17.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those last 4.5 laps turned out to be my greatest demise.\nDespite the team screaming at me to keep making moves and catch the Wisconsin\nrunner ahead of me who was wearing a backwards hat, my legs were absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. While I should’ve been\nclosing the gap between me and the runners ahead, the gap just stayed a\nconstant size. I didn’t realize how much I was slowing down until I saw the\nclock was at 13:00 with 3 laps to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fuck. I need to run 3 consecutive\n80 second laps to run sub 17? This is going to be hard</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stayed as mentally tough as I could, grinding through the\npain, telling myself not to give up, and trying to pick up the pace. But I\nslowed down way too much for it to matter at that point, as I sprinted the last\n200m as hard as I possibly could, only to run a very demoralizing 17:09. 1\nsecond slower than last week. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was completely exhausted after crossing the line and couldn’t\nexplain how I had failed to break 17 yet again. I paced the first 2 miles\nexactly how I wanted to, passed so many runners who had gone out too aggressively,\ntapered my training during the week going into the race, and despite all of\nthat, it still wasn’t enough to break 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my teammates tried to encourage my, telling me I ran a\ngood race despite the result, I couldn’t help but feel like I completely wasted\nmy big chance. Colin tried to rally me, by telling me that I was in sub 17\nshape, and I just needed the perfect race to do it, but there I was in perfect\nrunning conditions with a bunch of my teammates setting up a cheering squad that\nstretched the entire length of the track, and I still couldn’t get the job\ndone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt awful, and I thought it couldn’t get worse. But somehow\nit did, because I proceeded to watch the rest of the boys run the races of\ntheir lives and run amazing PR’s, cumulating in a 15:09 from Mitch to place 6<sup>th</sup>\nin the nation. I was so excited and happy for my teammates, but afterwards I\ncouldn’t help feel slightly bad because while almost everyone else ran amazing in\nthe 5k and broke their PR’s by at least 20-30 seconds, I still couldn’t find a\nway to chop 9 stupid seconds off of my time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of the others, including Singer, Laskowski, Stas, and\nMitch, had their moment of amazing racing and showing everyone how fit they\nwere.

Don’t worry about the time”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might not have realized it at the time, but those words would turn out to be very important as they stuck in my head for the next few hours. After a lot of thought, I realized that for the past 2 years I had been so worried about running sub 17 that I had almost completely ignored the racing aspect of it. It had gotten to the point where maybe my starts have been too conservative. Maybe going out more aggressively and seeking out competition was what I needed to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I decided that Mitch probably knew how to run a\n5k properly and that I should take his advice, essentially scraping my previous\nrace strategy and solely focusing on competing with the other runners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of hours later, after visualizing the race multiple times, I stepped on the track in my green Michigan State singlet tucked into my bright neon yellow running shorts that would’ve made even the most colorblind spectators cringe. You would think that as I toed the line in what could be my last ever collegiate track 5k, I would be thinking about how much training I’ve done to get to this point, my past racing failures, and how this race would be different. But there was only one thought on my mind as I stared down the starter, fueled by the 10 hours of anticipation I had spent watching the track meet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Just fire the damn gun.\nI’m ready to race</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Boom.</em> The gun was fired. The race had begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I instantly went out and attached myself to the back of an 8-runner\npack. I stayed calm and relaxed, keeping a constant position at the back of the\npack while playing Morgan Wallen (shoutout to Rylan for getting me hip) country\nsongs in my head. The first 2 laps are rather uneventful, as I dodge a bunch of\naggressive early moves, just trying to avoid stumbling and falling. But as we approached\nthe 2 lap mark, I thought to myself:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Briggs you are here\nwith a chance to break 17 and you are just singing songs about tractors and\nwhiskey? Wake the fuck up it’s time to race. This is your last chance.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost instantly, the songs I had been previously singing to\nmyself stopped. As I stop singing to myself, a runner in a bright green Rowan\nsinglet does a jump cut to the outside of lane 2, cutting me off while he\nstumbles and almost falls in the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Well that was a stupid\nmove. Its 2 laps into the 12.5 lap race idiot, why are you trying to imitate Odell\nBeckham with an aggressive juke / jump cut around a pack?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aggressive / idiotic move woke me up, as I quickly realized I felt great, my form was smooth, and my legs felt super light. I instantly weaved my way through the 8 person pack, right past the runner from Rowan and attached myself to the back of a 3 person pack, a move that was met with roaring approval from Coach Anderson. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we’re 4 laps into the race, and my pack and I round the\ncorner as Ryun yells out that I had just run an 80 second lap and was at 5:17 for\nthe mile, indicating I am running at a great pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Perfect. 5:17 and I\nstill feel smooth. Let’s catch some more of these boys!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so I did, passing groups of other competitors, and attaching myself to the pack of another pack before I made another surge. Pack by pack, I passed them like clockwork until the halfway point of the race, where I tuck in behind a stray runner in an effort to save energy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the race. Ryun was yelling out my splits and I was running at a constant 79/80 second clip, so I knew I just had to maintain the pace for as long as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I passed Ryun on the 7<sup>th</sup> lap, he was not\nhappy with my race strategy, screaming at me to not get complacent, to not stop\npassing people, and to keep making moves. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Ugh Ryun, I’m already\nway ahead of pace I don’t need to make moves. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I was too tired to argue, so I obediently surged ahead\nto another pack of runners and inserted myself in the middle of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8 laps down. Ryun is happy with my recent move and yells out that I’m on <em>sub 16:40 pace</em> through 2 miles, before correcting himself immediately after and yelling that I’m actually on <em>sub 16:30 pace</em>. Normally I would’ve gained a boost in confidence from that 2 mile split. But all I could think about were my closing 400 splits from Nationals a week prior. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>84, 86, 87, 83. You were on pace last week at this same point but then you did that, so nothing is guaranteed. You’re way ahead of pace, just don’t die super hard, keep your shoulders down, your form relaxed, and you’ll be fine</em>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I waited to feel the familiar feeling of my legs turning to iron, and for sheer exhaustion to break my will to race, I somehow kept passing packs and stray runners. And the feeling of misery that I had become very familiar with last week never manifested itself. . . until 1000m to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the first time in the race, a runner has just passed me, and immediately threw in a surge to go chase the next pack. I was tired, my legs started moving a little slower, and I couldn’t match his aggressive move. Ryun screamed at me, with a tone of urgency saying I had to <em>go</em> and speed up <em>now. </em>His tone of urgency and intensity made me believe I had fallen off pace and was in danger of missing sub 17. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Oh no. Here we go again. I\'m going to miss sub 17 again aren\'t I?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as I worried about failing to reach my ultimate goal and\nslowing down, something amazing happened. Something I didn’t know I needed. Something\nthat would help me to overcome any mental barriers my brain had previously constructed\nto block me from sub 17.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A runner passed me. But this wasn’t just any runner. This was the runner in a bright green Rowan University singlet who had been cutting me off and stumbling the first two laps of the race like an idiot. And I didn’t forget any of those previous moves for a second, because as soon as he passed me, a sense of anger swept through my body and I forgot about how tired I felt and focused on how badly I wanted to beat this dude.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But why was I so angry at him? I didn’t even know this kid. Was it the dumb unnecessary moves he made early on in the race? <em>Maybe. </em>Was it the fact that I couldn’t tell whether his singlet was yellow, bright green, or orange due to my colorblind eyes? <em>Maybe. </em>But it didn’t matter why I was angry, all that mattered is in that instant of time, I gained so much motivation and energy from him passing me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediately, I throw in a surge to try and match his speed. I succeed, managing keeping the gap between us at a constant size. With 300 meters to go, I make another surge and pass the guy. I feel him try to match my move and stay on my shoulder, but his steps become quieter with every second as I know I have just created a gap between us. With 150 meters to go, his coaches on the infield are screaming at him to kick hard and catch me. The thought of him beating me in the final straightaway of the race made me absolutely <em>furious.</em> I look dead at his coaches and think to myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>These are the guys that want you to catch me? Well, let’s see you try to come and get me buddy.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I throw in a final surge, speeding up to a full sprint, trying\nto break whatever was left of his spirit. I wasn’t going for a close win at the\nfinish line, I wanted to absolute <em>destroy</em>\nthis kid and make him regret those moves he made earlier in the race. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>100 meters left, I\'m still in front and feeling like I\'m pulling away. 50 meters left, and I know I have this Rowan kid beat, as I can barely hear his breathing anymore. I sprint all the way to the line but can’t help but stare at the clock during the last 25 meters in sheer amazement. As I cross the finish line, I have a grin on my face, staring directly at the clock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>16:27. A 41 second PR.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It Finally happened.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 2 years of failure, I had finally achieved my goal of sub\n17. I hadn’t just broken it by a little bit either, I had absolutely demolished\nthe barrier and went ahead and broke 16:30 as well. This was the race of my\nlife. This was my moment that I had been waiting for. I laid down on the track in\npure disbelief, as Ryun ran over with the same grin and disbelief I had, congratulating\nme and saying we had finally done it. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Meaning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the race, I was ecstatically happy. I still couldn’t\nbelieve I had run that fast. I thought the best part of the day was finishing\nthe race, having broken the barrier that had cruelly taunted me for the past\ntwo years. But it turns out the best part was actually seeing the club’s\nreaction online when Ryun and I got back to the car and turned on my phone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Facebook chat had blown up, with so many congratulatory messages from so many different people.

Bare with me because this is gonna be a long one. I first had the idea to make a blog post about my time with the club last spring semester. I got lost in my last semester of college and soon enough graduated and had to spend my time applying to full-time jobs. I thought the time had passed to tell my story, but what is time anyway? It’s completely made up (@daylight savings when we all just collectively decide to change time?! What kind of sorcery). SO, now that I have ample free time at night since I no longer have homework/studying and am feeling nostalgic, I felt it was a good time to revisit my blog post idea. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The blog has become a place where we can form a sense of community, share our deepest (or most surface level) thoughts, analyze our races, or maybe just meme. I was, according to Katrina, a tau rho success story‒I started coming around semi-regularly spring of my freshman year but kept to myself a lot. No one expected me to stick around. In fact, I was almost given the “most likely to stick around even though we thought she wouldn’t” paper plate award sophomore year. No joke. I proved them wrong. And I hope that by sharing my journey I will help others to prove themselves wrong (coming back from injuries that you thought would be the end), to inspire them to do things they never thought they would or could do (run a 1500m pr more than four years later or do a half marathon practically at your old 5k pr pace), to defy other people’s expectations of themselves (an introvert running for social chair??), and to learn to be proud of themselves, even if it’s for small things. For anyone who may be reading this that is a prospective or a not yet fully committed club member, I would encourage you to stick around too and I promise it will be worth it. Part of me also wants to write this for myself and for my own enjoyment. I hope you enjoy it too. Maybe one day I will read this to my kids when they ask about what I did in college. Until then, buckle up and prepare for a bumpy ride...<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It should be noted that as I write this that I am not finished with all parts yet. I’m not even halfway done. I’m not sure how long it will take me to finish, but I’m excited to share so I decided I will post them in separate installments. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Freshman Year</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Fall 2015</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I entered college feeling certain about very few things. Actually, I probably entered college feeling certain about nothing-except that I wanted to keep running on a team. I was very much a timid freshman. The track and cross country teams were the main sources of my friends and social life in general in high school, and I knew that joining club running was probably one of my best shots at making friends in college. I have vague memories of showing up to my first club running practice in the back of Cole Field House (RIP) in early September and handing a waiver to someone I can only guess was Dylan Hernandez. Abby Cahalan, then treasurer and always a social butterfly, came right up and introduced herself to me as I stood by myself waiting for practice to begin. After listening to Dylan quip that “It’s a great day for running, just like it always is,” I awkwardly shuffled to the group of unfamiliar girls deciding where to run that day. In a shock to no one, the girls came to a consensus to run lake that day, as Caity Adams (only TRUE terp runners will remember her) groaned that she was already tired of running lake after just transferring to UMD that semester. I can’t say I remember much else about that run other than falling behind and turning around early. I returned to my dorm proud of myself for attending my first club practice in college but discouraged that I was already struggling to stay with the group on an easy run.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fun and random fact, the first friend I made in college was none other than Luanne Zimmermann’s roommate. She also ran in high school and expressed interest in doing club running, so we decided to go to practice together. That would make it easier, we thought, having another new person to stick with in a group full of strangers. She was in freshmen connection and could only make practice on Fridays, so the second day of practice I attended was a Friday afternoon slightly later in September. Little did we know, Fridays were workout days and there was a GOOD one (by good I mean horrible) on the workout plan for that day: 2 mile repeats on cherry unchill! It is pretty important to note, my friends, that I had barely run during that rollercoaster of a summer 2015 so I was very out of shape to say the least. I stuck with a group of new people who also had no idea what they were in for and got lost on the warmup before finding our way to the mile markers on cherry hill where everyone else was preparing to start the workout. I was able to complete one “rep” before deciding to turn around and go back because at that point, I’m pretty sure I had hit my mileage limit for the day. I ditched my friend who was attempting a second rep and went back to stately Anne Arundel Hall, again shaking my head that I couldn’t make it through another practice.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not sure exactly when, but at one of the few practices I attended I met and briefly spoke to THE Katrina Hrabinski. We were talking about what our favorite events were in high school, and when I said I liked the 800, she told me I looked like an 800 runner. She was wearing a New Balance Nationals backpack. I quivered in my Asics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe I went to one or two more practices that fall, again falling behind the group and running by myself. I thought, <em>What’s the point of coming to run with a group if I just end up by myself a mile in? I might as well just run on my own at my own pace at a time that’s convenient for me so I don’t have to feel self conscious about being “slow.” It’s not worth it. I wasn’t prepared for this. </em>A bout of what can only be described as a precursor to the great club running plague of 2018 caused me to fall ill right after Halloween that year and pretty much halted all of my exercising for the remainder of the semester. Season 1/8 was done before it even started.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'One Long Run-My Journey Through Club Running: Part 1', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'one-long-run-my-journey-through-club-running-part-1', '', '', '2019-11-05 22:17:51', '2019-11-06 03:17:51', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=405', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Bare with me because this is gonna be a long one. I first had the idea to make a blog post about my time with the club last spring semester. I got lost in my last semester of college and soon enough graduated and had to spend my time applying to full-time jobs. I thought the time had passed to tell my story, but what is time anyway? It’s completely made up (@daylight savings when we all just collectively decide to change time?! What kind of sorcery).

In fact, I was almost given the “most likely to stick around even though we thought she wouldn’t” paper plate award sophomore year. No joke. I proved them wrong. And I hope that by sharing my journey I will help others to prove themselves wrong (coming back from injuries that you thought would be the end), to inspire them to do things they never thought they would or could do (run a 1500m pr more than four years later or do a half marathon practically at your old 5k pr pace), to defy other people’s expectations of themselves (an introvert running for social chair??), and to learn to be proud of themselves, even if it’s for small things. For anyone who may be reading this that is a prospective or a not yet fully committed club member, I would encourage you to stick around too and I promise it will be worth it. Part of me also wants to write this for myself and for my own enjoyment. I hope you enjoy it too. Maybe one day I will read this to my kids when they ask about what I did in college.

Actually, I probably entered college feeling certain about nothing-except that I wanted to keep running on a team. I was very much a timid freshman. The track and cross country teams were the main sources of my friends and social life in general in high school, and I knew that joining club running was probably one of my best shots at making friends in college. I have vague memories of showing up to my first club running practice in the back of Cole Field House (RIP) in early September and handing a waiver to someone I can only guess was Dylan Hernandez. Abby Cahalan, then treasurer and always a social butterfly, came right up and introduced herself to me as I stood by myself waiting for practice to begin. After listening to Dylan quip that “It’s a great day for running, just like it always is,” I awkwardly shuffled to the group of unfamiliar girls deciding where to run that day. In a shock to no one, the girls came to a consensus to run lake that day, as Caity Adams (only TRUE terp runners will remember her) groaned that she was already tired of running lake after just transferring to UMD that semester. I can’t say I remember much else about that run other than falling behind and turning around early. I returned to my dorm proud of myself for attending my first club practice in college but discouraged that I was already struggling to stay with the group on an easy run.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fun and random fact, the first friend I made in college was none other than Luanne Zimmermann’s roommate. She also ran in high school and expressed interest in doing club running, so we decided to go to practice together. That would make it easier, we thought, having another new person to stick with in a group full of strangers. She was in freshmen connection and could only make practice on Fridays, so the second day of practice I attended was a Friday afternoon slightly later in September. Little did we know, Fridays were workout days and there was a GOOD one (by good I mean horrible) on the workout plan for that day: 2 mile repeats on cherry unchill! It is pretty important to note, my friends, that I had barely run during that rollercoaster of a summer 2015 so I was very out of shape to say the least. I stuck with a group of new people who also had no idea what they were in for and got lost on the warmup before finding our way to the mile markers on cherry hill where everyone else was preparing to start the workout. I was able to complete one “rep” before deciding to turn around and go back because at that point, I’m pretty sure I had hit my mileage limit for the day. I ditched my friend who was attempting a second rep and went back to stately Anne Arundel Hall, again shaking my head that I couldn’t make it through another practice.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not sure exactly when, but at one of the few practices I attended I met and briefly spoke to THE Katrina Hrabinski. We were talking about what our favorite events were in high school, and when I said I liked the 800, she told me I looked like an 800 runner. She was wearing a New Balance Nationals backpack. I quivered in my Asics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe I went to one or two more practices that fall, again falling behind the group and running by myself. I thought, <em>What’s the point of coming to run with a group if I just end up by myself a mile in? I might as well just run on my own at my own pace at a time that’s convenient for me so I don’t have to feel self conscious about being “slow.” It’s not worth it. I wasn’t prepared for this. </em>A bout of what can only be described as a precursor to the great club running plague of 2018 caused me to fall ill right after Halloween that year and pretty much halted all of my exercising for the remainder of the semester.

The infamous Scott Berryman, ever running with the girls, happened to be on that run too and boy was he in an inquisitive mood. That would be the first of many occasions where I was harassed in the form of questions by Scott. They ranged from “What’s your major” (undeclared) to “What type of dog do you have” (a mutt). Every so often I would fall a bit back from the group, but this time I would speed up to catch up to everyone again.

If I wasn’t running at practice, I would run on my own. Once I felt ready for it, I even started doing workouts again. One weekend I was doing a workout by myself on the track at the same time as club-turned-varsity runner Pat Hanley. He approached me at one point and asked if I was planning on signing up for any meets that spring to which I replied no, I didn’t really feel like I was ready for racing yet. He encouraged me to anyway because it didn’t matter and the meets were fun. That comment stuck with me, so much so that it was the reason I changed my mind and signed up to race at Shippensburg that April. After a full year off from competitive running, I was poised to make my return.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>April 30th, 2016. I arrived outside of SPH bright and early and joined the absolute squad car of me, driver Dan Russo, Frank Tiburzi, Trey Crump, and Katrina. I spoke maybe one sentence on the ride there. We made it to Shippensburg University in middle of nowhere, PA and took a spot on the bleachers. It was exciting just being in the atmosphere of a track meet again. I watched my new teammates run their races for most of the morning and early afternoon. At long last, it was time for me to start warming up. I was the only girl on the club in the open 800 that day, so I jogged around and stretched by myself anxiously. The pre-race nerves started to kick in, a feeling that I hadn’t felt in nearly 12 months. I received some support from Danny “thanks so much for coming to my house!” Schofield who cheered my name from the sidelines as I headed to the starting line. I thought to myself, <em>How does he know my name?</em> Anyway, I took my position and waited for the command. A moment that probably lasted a split second felt like an eternity, and then suddenly the gun went off and the race was on. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having not raced in a while, I went out with the pack and let them set the pace. After just 200 meters though, I was feeling like they were holding me back. I took the lead half a lap in and never looked back, crossing the finish line first from the slow heat and surprising myself in the process. The clock read 2:45, only 10 seconds off of my high school PR, and having gone in with zero expectations other than to at least break three minutes, much better than I expected! The most surprising part, however, had to be how GOOD I felt after finishing! I had so much energy it was like I could’ve run the race all over again and done it even faster. (Hint hint, we would soon find out that was not the case.) I couldn’t believe I had ever let go of that post-race runners high that I used to feel after good runs in high school. It felt amazing to be back. I can’t express how glad I am that I made the last minute decision to race that spring. This meet was just the beginning of my college running career and I was so excited to see where it went. As I returned to the bleachers still beaming from my race I was asked if I wanted to run ANOTHER 800 but this time in a 4x8 with Abby, Esther, and Katrina. How could I say no to that?! The team needed a fourth leg and I was glad to get another race in before the season ended, plus relays are always fun. Katrina led off the race with a scorching 2:23 first leg and handed off to me in first place. I was almost immediately passed by half the field before hitting a complete wall on the second lap and getting passed by the rest of the field. We finished the race in second to last with neither Abby (who had steepled earlier), Esther (who had just finished the 3k), or I breaking 2:50 but hey, we got Katrina a chance to run a 2:23 and we were all just happy to be there. It was a great end to a fulfilling day.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was itching to run more races after getting my first club competition under my belt. Luckily, I still had one more chance to race that semester: the Frederick Half Marathon. I had never done a half before; in high school, me and my teammates considered 7 miles to be a pretty long run. As a somewhat distance runner though, I felt like I should give it a try and see how far I could push my limits. I was finding my ~passion~ for running again. The longest run I did in preparation was 9 miles and I felt incredible afterwards. I was confident I could’ve continued for another 4 miles if I wanted to, but I was saving it for race day. I awoke at approximately 4:15 am the morning of the race, put on the coolest possible running outfit I had (look good run good), and slowly made my way to SPH for our 4:45 am departure. We arrived at the Frederick Fairgrounds at about 6 am after picking up Scott* from his late night shift at bents. I distinctly remember Abby* attempting to tweet from the club twitter that the gun went off at 7 am, but it was autocorrected to “fun goes off at 7 am,” which she kept‒a fitting tweet in my opinion. My goal for the race was to break 2 hours. I remember going out pretty fast (for me) through the first 7/8 miles, feeling great at first, but then having to slow down for the next few miles. Having zero half marathon experience definitely hindered my pacing abilities. Nonetheless, I was able to break my goal by nearly 8 minutes with a finishing time of 1:52! Not bad for a semester in which I didn’t plan on racing at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*If you haven’t already seen it, I highly recommend you all scroll back on the Maryland Club Running Facebook page to see Scott and Abby’s photo album from this race.

I was actually starting to feel like I found my place at UMD.

Twenty-sixteen had to be the only time I ever made a New Year’s Resolution and kept it. What was my resolution? To go back to club running practices and not quit. I entered the semester with a newfound resolve. I <em>loved </em>running in high school. With a team. With myself. For the racing. For the workouts. For the social aspect. For the fun of it. For the feeling of accomplishment. To see how much I could improve. I was determined to get back to that for all of the aforementioned reasons. Also, I had approximately one friend other than my roommates and, as the kids say, I was straight up NOT having a good time in college. I needed to ~find my place~ and make some more friends, otherwise it was going to be a very long four years.

I was leading people on runs, bringing north campus freshmen to social events, and answering new people’s questions about the club. I still felt pretty new to the club, but I guess I was becoming more of a leader and feeling like one too. That winter break, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the NIRCA winter conference in Boston with Dolf, Briggs, Ethan, Katrina and Hiro. I was the only non-officer in attendance and I had a great time and gained more of an appreciation for NIRCA and for the club sphere. I had a chance to voice my opinions (while Harry from UPenn stopped talking for five seconds) about the direction NIRCA is going in and plans for future nationals and make connections with other club runners. There was even one runner from BU’s club team there that I knew from XC camp in high school that I got to see! My further involvement in club and NIRCA happenings solidified my status as a truly involved member of the club.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that my first full season of training and racing with the club was complete after a brief hiatus from competition post-high school, I thought I would be primed to have a successful season of running that spring. Key word thought. Not much progress was made that season. I was running everyday and doing all the workouts, but it just didn’t feel like my overall fitness was really improving. It seemed like every run was a struggle to finish-even the easy ones. I could do an easy short run and somehow feel like I had just done the hardest run of my life. The only good thing about doing workouts was listening to Luanne count down the reps: “Only 3 more til we’re halfway done!” “Only 2 more until we’re halfway to being halfway done!” “Only one more until we’re at the countdown!” (the countdown being 3-2-1). While Luanne’s enthusiasm during workouts was certainly helpful, it wasn’t changing the fact that I felt so tired after practice everyday. I didn’t really understand it, but nonetheless kept training.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Racing wise, spring of 2016 was very random and sporadic. It was also the season where I was afraid of the mile/1500. I opened the season with the one and only indoor meet for us, the Happy Valley Invitational. It was an exciting atmosphere with a nice track. We also brought a nice helping of girls to run. We had enough for two whole women’s DMRs!!&nbsp; Being that many of my teammates had specific legs they wanted to run and that I was also afraid of running anything moderately long because of how slow my time would be, I filled in as the 400 leg. A nice and (relatively) quick and fun two laps around the oval was an easy way to open the track season. It’s not like my 400 split mattered that much‒I never even found out what it was. I took a brief cooldown outside and waited for my next race, the open 800. I ran a very unremarkable time in the open 8 later as the lactic acid took over my muscles, but I thoroughly enjoyed being at the meet and racing. It was the first of the season and there was still plenty of time for improvement.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next opportunity for racing didn’t come until club Penn Relayz (I missed UMBC earlier in the season) at historic Franklin Field. Everyone that had been to club Penn Relayz before raved about it-the pick your own batons, the distance runners doing 4x1s, the shot glasses as prizes--so I, and everyone else, was very excited for this meet! One difference this year though was that the meet was moved from late April to late March and that made for some way chillier temperatures for race day. Some wonderful parents came to support us anyway though, including mine and Julia’s. Penn Relayz, as the name indicates, is the ideal time to partake in some relays. I decided to do just that, running in a swedish medley relay and a 4x4. I also originally signed up for the open mile, but like I mentioned earlier I was afraid of the mile and how could I risk tiring myself out when I had some very important sprint races to do! According to Britney, our then sprint captain, I actually did a really good blind handoff in our swedish relay and we creamed the only other team in the race so it was worth it. I had earned myself a club Penn Relayz shot glass! Except they did not have any to give out that year and we were all under the impression that we would be receiving some after winning all the races. No surprise that we haven’t gone back to that meet since.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spring track nationals was only a few weeks after club penn. After having the time of my life at xc nats, I was so ready for another jam-packed NIRCA weekend. My van consisted of Luanne, Briggs, Jonathon Shinholt, and Kirk Morris, a good mix of sprinters/distance and people who I knew and didn’t really know. Would this be my chance to hear life stories and tell my own?! I hoped so. It was still pretty cold when we left that early April morning. In fact, when I took the second shift driving the van starting in Cumberland, MD, IT STARTED SNOWING. <em>Wtf</em> I thought <em>why did this have to start as soon as I took the wheel? </em>I clutched the steering wheel for dear life while we slowly inched up some mountainous terrain. Kirk generously offered to take over driving, but I couldn’t bear the shame of pulling over on the side of the road and switching back to the passenger seat after a five minute shift. I just had to take it r e a l&nbsp; s l o w. Of course we had also merged into a one lane road so I was now backing up cars behind me with one of those cars being one of our vans where Trey was complaining about my driving without knowing it was me.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I managed to make it through a two-hour stint behind the wheel without causing any accidents or near death experiences this time thankfully. Our car was getting <strong>very </strong>anxious to finally make it to Indiana, though we managed to keep ourselves entertained with the glorious emergence of NIRCA Snaps. Anything was, and still is, fair game for NIRCA snaps&nbsp; All you have to do is insert the word NIRCA in front of another word/phrase to make it instantly cool and worthy of being shared on a snapchat story to hundreds of people. We NIRCA athletes have very high standards of course. Also butt chugging was very important (at least to Rob).&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We finally arrived at what was definitely the nicest lodging we’ve ever stayed in as a club. I wish I remembered the name of it so I can stay there in the future when I go to Indiana (HA), but actually it was very log cabin-y in a nicer, more modern way. There was a super nice outdoor fire pit area where we roasted marshmallows on Saturday night while Ethan was on the verge of body slamming Trey in a sleeping bag. 5/5 stars. I got a nice and cozy rest wedged in between Shannon and Katrina in our possibly queen sized bed before getting up to go cheer on Norf Norf in the Hoosier half marathon. We camped out by the Indiana frat/sorority houses as our first cheering spot. I only feel the need to mention that because the houses were absolute MANSIONS and they all had unique designs.They put Maryland’s houses to shame. Cheering for the marathon with Dolf, Ethan, Luanne, and Marcel was without a doubt my favorite part of that weekend. It was just an all around great atmosphere with good vibes and supportive runners-a splendid way to start track nationals.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile everyone else was gearing up for a long day of races at the track. We kicked off the day with the 4x800 relay. One of my best friends from high school was also running the 4x8 for Purdue’s running club but in the slow heat (lame). Nevertheless, it got me even more excited to race that day. Katrina, Luanne, Shannon and I warmed up and stretched together, while watching the slow heat. Before starting, we gathered for a pre-race huddle and got photographed by NIRCA’s official photography crew, one of my most cherished pictures from a club event.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Katrina led off strong and passed the baton to me on the second leg. As usual, I went out at a pace that I couldn’t keep up and slowed down a lot on the second lap. My time was somewhere in the high 2:40s, not what I was hoping for on the big stage. Shannon and Luanne held their own for the next two legs and helped us to an eleventh place finish and a new women’s club 4x8 record! I was glad to have my team to rely on and carry me to the only club record I would ever be a part of (until it was broken the next year at nationals). I had another 800 to run later on much more fatigued legs and only just managed to break three minutes. I almost always ran significantly worse in my second event of the day in high school and this was no different. The disappointing times didn’t bother me though since I was having such a good time overall with the team at our biggest meet of the season. The rest of the day was spent chilling and watching races, mainly while laying in the grass with Luanne and Katrina making guesses on what times our guys would run in their 1500s.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZthaBVgnzri6XM962T55GDUAp28YvPcDpSqHO3Q75Hj2i-pJmHK79WxmYQihavmr6CKaCtP9yY2aHE7HrTIYY8DogBDtNCQJw8k7CHfxFb5BtID8r6p7SlvvEgRB7BQrfNUid23j\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CQe1W-y2ivWLiQQALfQ4YlOnXGhjQVLgfs1ibcq8EDhLnsjT06jZWspmWWREkwQSL1zsbUrowFt3ARnq6Y-SLf239UQqfAvRLSZ0_ghK7MCgziMuGUAorA1dEPlfyUH9R8ktVnDa\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hGnT71Esmk-YnJwSAwH1ecSj2utovL9ipkaSfsXFRJhxom-44vIHOgN_pZHoYjXlZwhR5w80akaK3yRPYlUfbsRTvVbZ7tFdreJVfl2OhFD9s2GS_XdTNBXGD3TJijf6UUOJ7lrs\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Target in Indiana hits different</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later that night we had an...interesting dinner at what was essentially a fast food restaurant but for pasta. The cashier was sketchily pulling mass produced salads out from under the counter and the manager was offering us endless breadsticks. The most interesting part though was that Rob’s dad, who had traveled with him out to Indiana, joined us for the meal. Afterwards, my car took an eventful trip to target where Dolf and Ethan argued over whether to get Patsy (the birthday boy) a birthday cake and eventually settled on some butterfly shaped pastries and s’mores supplies. With stomachs full of questionable dietary choices, we tucked ourselves into bed before the second and final day of spring track nationals.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Day two got underway immediately as everyone was trying to get the heck out of Indiana and back home before class on Monday morning. The big event for me (and Katrina, Shannon, and Luanne) that day was the women’s 1500, and I distinctly remember none of us wanting to do it. My excuse was that I had a feeling I would run slow after seeing my times from the day before. Also, I was legitimately afraid of running a 1500/mile. I hadn’t done one since spring track counties my senior year of high school, and that was one of the worst, saddest races I had ever run. I didn’t ever want to relive that race, so I stayed away. It made me feel better knowing that the other girls were all considering scratching except, my fear and doubts getting the best of me, I was the only one that actually wound up scratching. The culminating event, like at most track meets, was the 4x4. Katrina, Luanne, Shannon and I reconvened once more to #squadup for the relay (funny how that happens when only five girls sign up for a meet), this time more focused on just having fun. After all, this was NIRCA and there were girls in our heat racing in flannels and backwards baseball caps calling it the “4 by fun.” I was very here for the 4 by fun, in fact I think that should be the mindset everyone has about running a 4x4. With that in mind, we smiled our way through 1600m of pure Nirca joy to cap off the weekend. Obviously that race was my favorite one that I ran that weekend. It helped that there was absolutely no pressure!&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hit the road, one “rush back” car actually having left first thing that morning, ready for the long journey back to College Park, but not quite ready to go back to school and the real world. I had a very intimate car ride home consisting of deep life talks late into the night with Briggs, Luanne, Dolf and Shinholt. THIS was the true nationals van experience I had heard so much about. Admittedly, I fell asleep at some point during the second half of the drive and woke up who knows how long later—except I pretended to still be asleep because I didn’t want to partake in the deep life convos at that time. I eavesdropped still half asleep from the very back row of the van. Yes, I am the worst, but I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about myself at the time and no one should feel pressured to. My time would come. Soon. Finally, we arrived in good ole CP in the wee hours of the morning, returned the vans, and crawled into bed, hopefully after taking a shower. Nationals may have been over but the season still wasn’t!<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next meet on the calendar was at Hopkins the weekend immediately after nationals. It was a Friday meet with some great DIII competition, but since it was on a Friday and that was back when I still had Friday classes, I had to forgo it for the sake of my academics. The Hopkins meet was followed by a weekend off before we returned to Shippensburg University for the Paul Kaiser Classic. Ahh, Shippensburg, where I made my return to racing just a year before. This time, I signed up for the 3000m steeplechase. Steeple was huge in New York and I had been dying to try steeple since freshman year of high school. I didn’t think I was good enough to do it as a freshman, though, so I never asked my coach to put me in it. I wanted to get better at running in general before attempting to run with barriers and water jumps. By the time I felt ready to try it senior year of high school and asked my coach about it, he said we needed to “get me healthy first.” For context, I missed the beginning of that spring season because of injury and I guess I never got healthy enough for my coach to let me try steepling. Alas, part of the beauty of club running is that you have the freedom to sign up for whatever the heck you want (@Shannon and Julia in the shot put) without having to get it okayed with a coach, and it was steeple time.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I practiced some barrier jumps that week during practice. Thanks to my time as a hurdler in middle school, I was able to clear the barriers with ease and didn’t suddenly get scared when approaching them like some people do. The women’s steeple that day at Ship only had five entrants—three of which were me, Eileen, and Rachel. I had a lot of fun trying out a new event that day, although I wished I ran it a little bit faster. I may have been the worst at running in that race (I finished 4th out of 4 after one girl dropped), but according to the spectators, I was the best at the hurdling part which gave me a sense of accomplishment. On another note, we had an absolute squad of girls at Ship that day, most of which were underclassmen. Now that we had such a solid it was exciting to think where the club would continue to go on the girl’s side in the future. Not only were we running with each other, but we were becoming good friends with each other too! The night before Shippensburg, eight of us bussed over to the tattoery, still sweaty from practice, and got some ear piercings. That will forever be one of the best bonding experiences I’ve had with the club girls. I loved the spontaneity of it. Unfortunately, that is an expensive tradition to keep up and we would all eventually run out of piercings that we want to get, so we have not had a team piercing trip since. Maybe the next generation of club girls can bring it back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BC69mna_9h8oxNhB-MryAD_-Id4bsTaPdYEVhGGAGCF0LnLscUsYxjXmLGmJPJNJxyGNCUnUCmlGd23lYY_0AIaXi-iRyAeuU6dUUirKxEWLUI39Z5mVYrxKgqCp8CyYztzo4AdE\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JDLi7VFa-00WlUH30bjmiWbS0fy-DMCMkqGeDDE5eyjivCITyq8q8NqDCSmnMl6fOTRo3OYj-b2wSyuFDSpoXrxxhebajimSTKF1INh0ySgoP5SvWFQhRNIzRYuHFx1S6GbgMjWR\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Absolute SQUAD</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With that race in the books, my weird season with inconsistent racing, absent fitness, and a lingering feeling of fatigue was over. I was extremely ready for a break after Ship. As much as I loved running Frederick freshman year, there was absolutely no way my body could handle 13.1 miles, even if I took it easy. It was time for a much needed break before gearing up for a fresh season of cross country. Funnily enough, when we were talking about who had signed up for the half at practice one day, Luanne was surprised to find out that I hadn’t. She just assumed I did because I signed up for almost about everything with the club! I was flattered and pleased that in a year I had gone from a random, quiet girl that people did not think would stick around to a consistent and devoted club member that people had come to expect to be around all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Outside of racing and competing, there were still plenty of fun things to do with the club that spring, like underclassmen dinners (did somebody say smoothie tower?), volunteering at kehoe, playing intramurals (one of my favorite aspects-more later!!!), and other end of semester extracurricular activities I enjoyed spring ‘17 a lot despite not having a single good race, speaking more to the beauty of club running. Even when you’re not at your best, being around the team and the good vibes surrounding it is enough to make what seems like a failure of a season into a successful, fun, and memorable one. Season 4/8 taught me to appreciate the little things and not fixate on your own personal failures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"width\":585,\"height\":438} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OuDhJK6GuY5uRPSwhaAJR63EWoGKXE7YtCHYoiyElcKD9oldQwDttogRBFJe51P__AYAKW378WdnYxmBKifkbMML4KKwLWPQ_4LmVGUg1C-CaxbbDyy4py4jsxaMyfaCuugnBsg_\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"438\" /><figcaption>Reaching our smoothie tower destiny</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->', 'My Journey Through Club Running: Part 4', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-journey-through-club-running-part-4', '', '', '2019-11-29 22:43:29', '2019-11-30 03:43:29', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=416', 0, 'post', '', 0),

What if I used the weekly email platform for something more than just announcements? The benefits of spending more time preparing the email were twofold; if I put entertaining content in my emails, hopefully people would actually read them (or at least open them), <em>and</em>, maybe it would give people something to talk about with new people at practice. A well-crafted email, as trivial as it seemed, could serve not only as a vehicle to more effectively deliver important announcements, but also as a conversation starter to combat those silent runs when everyone has been so tired and busy that nobody has anything to talk about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, while wholly unnecessary and of my own volition, I stuck to it and spent an inordinate amount of time brainstorming how I could possibly write content that people would enjoy every week. Over the past year, I’ve churned out “inspirational sections” for almost every weekly email I’ve sent. Some of them were well thought-out reflections on contemporary issues in sports or profiles on exceptional athletes. Some were praises of accomplishments within our own community. When I really got busy with other things, some inspiration sections became shorter and more comedic than inspirational (you <em>bet</em> I wrote an inspirational section about our Med-Kit, fight me). Not all inspiration sections are created equal, but every week I tried to write something that would either get people excited about a week of practice, cheer people up after a hard week, or at the very least get a chuckle out of people on a slow Monday morning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However,\nthe more I wrote, as much as I liked subjecting my captive audience to my overdramatic\nwriting, I hit a tough realization. Like the writers of Game of Thrones, I was\nrunning out of material from which to draw content. The stakes of my posts were\nrising rapidly. I had gone from pulling up random comedic news articles to\ndoing extended write-ups of professional athletes who had achieved impossible feats.\nAfter proudly finishing up another inspiration section, my mood would\nimmediately flip: “How are you gonna build on this? How are you gonna go from\ntalking about running legends like Allyson Felix and Kipchoge to sharing a video\nof a cat falling out of a tree without dying, and expect people to still take\nyou seriously?” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\nmade it even harder on myself by doubling down when I ran out of time to write\none, promising that next week would be twice as good to make up for this week’s\ndisappointment. That brings us to this blog post, which is going to be way too\nlong for its own good. With Nationals six days in the future, I wanted to do\nsomething special, but at the same time I wanted it to be personalized and\nrelatable to those finishing up their seasons this weekend, <em>especially</em>\nfor those who will be rounding out their cross country careers this Saturday.\nThus, this week’s inspiration is going to be all about my experiences with\nMaryland Club Running, how it impacted my outlook on the sport for the better,\nand why I believe we should remind ourselves why we dedicate so much time to\nthe sport.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When\nI joined the Club three years ago, I had very similar thoughts on running that\nsome of the other competitive members of the club did. I was a pretty\naccomplished high school athlete that had not received an offer to run for a\ncollege team and, as a result, I felt slighted by the sport. I had spent four\nyears in high school pouring myself into my training to become as fast as I\ncould, with people telling me I was special the whole time. My coaches gave me extra\nattention, upperclassmen who I looked up to told me that I was going to be\nfaster than they were when I got to their age, and surges of pride coursed\nthrough me whenever a local running news source included my name in a write-up of\na recent meet. I set a pair of school records (both of which have since been\nshattered) and earned a couple medals and ribbons at championships. I loved the\nidea that people who I had never spoken to before knew who I was when I stepped\ninto a race, and I loved racing and showing off the results of my training and\ngetting recognized for my achievements. However, the absence of a college offer\nwounded my fragile, privileged, self-centered, Montgomery County relationship\nwith the sport. I wasn’t as talented as I thought I was. I wasn’t special, and\nI was not going to compete in the NCAA. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However,\nI wasn’t ready to accept being done with competition, so I decided to become a\nclub athlete. Joining the Club was going to be a brief blip in my competitive\nrunning career: a stepping-stone on my path to restore my old way of life. I\nwas going to wipe the floor with all the club competition and prove that I was\nsomething more than some club runner who peaked in high school. More than\nanything, I wanted to prove to myself that my efforts in high school running\nhad been worth something. I was going to run times that a varsity coach\ncouldn’t ignore, and I would move up to the varsity team and reclaim my\ntenuously defined self-worth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately for me, none of that happened. My path through college running was far less linear than I would have imagined, and I believe I’m better off for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I walked into my first cross country race with the Club and realized that I wasn’t even within the top seven runners on the team. I painted myself as some hot shot, D1 hopeful runner, and here I was getting smacked in <em>club</em> races. However, I re-doubled my efforts to get back into my old form, pumped up my mileage, and pushed myself to the wall on every interval workout. In the short term, it enabled me to achieve my goals. I finished 2<sup>nd</sup> place for the team at Nationals in Hershey that year, and I carried that momentum as I set my sights on track season, where I zeroed in on my first collegiate running goal: breaking 4 minutes in the 1500m. If you’ve ever heard me talk about track, you’d know that the sub-4 1500 is one of my longest held time goals. More importantly, you’d also know that I have not achieved it. Indeed, doubling your average weekly mileage (and doing all of it on concrete), doing extra interval workouts too early in your training cycle, and lifting weights improperly is a perfect recipe for a stress injury, and I had prepared it excellently. Two days after my first college track race, I could barely walk up and down the stairs to my dorm. My ill-advised training had damaged my left knee enough to keep me out of my entire freshman year of track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After\na long, sad semester of hobbling around campus and physical therapy, it was\ntime to get to work once again. I built my mileage slowly and deliberately in\nthe summer leading up to my sophomore year, focused solely on being a NIRCA\nAll-American in the fall. However, I ended up cutting my summer training short\nin August to go to Peru on a trip with Engineers without Borders, where\ntraining simply wasn’t feasible. After missing 3 weeks of training right before\nthe semester began, I had essentially wiped out the gains from my summer\ntraining and spent the fall building back up from scratch, resulting in what I\nwould call a mediocre season. Track was better. I set the club record in the\n1500m (albeit two seconds short of my 3:59 goal), plateaued very early in the\nseason, and underperformed at Nationals. It was alright, but I still hadn’t hit\nmy goals and was still left wanting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, I reacted to underperforming the way I had taught myself to react through 8 years of running; I doubled down again. I hit my highest mileage summer ever leading into junior year, albeit in a smarter fashion than I had done before my freshman track season (I did the extra strength training, got off the concrete and on to the trails, ate better, etc.). And, finally, it all seemed to pay off. I PR’d in the 8k by over 90 seconds and was on track to help the team with a historically high finish at Nationals. If you scroll back through this blog, you’ll find an even longer post of mine detailing exactly why that <em>didn’t </em>happen (TL;DR a large section of the team and I caught adenovirus two weeks before Nationals). After reading that essay, you may think “wow, this kid got really sad last year. There is no way he could possibly get sadder.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Surprise! After having a damn near perfect beginning to my junior track season, featuring my first major track victory at the Happy Valley 3k and a huge, 40 second 5k PR, I was closing in on yet another one of my goals: I was going to be All-American in the 5k. As I jogged to the track at 7AM on the Wednesday before Nationals to do a quick tune-up workout, I slipped off the sidewalk by the School of Public Health and inflicted astronomic levels of carnage on the tendons in my left ankle<em>.</em> As I write this, seven months after that sprain, my ankle has still not fully recovered. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It just wasn’t fair. I had done everything right this year. I hadn’t over-trained, I had done all the consistent work, and I had given everything I had in my races, only to be robbed <em>twice </em>in the same year of the achievements that I had worked toward for so long, bedridden by illness in the fall and hobbled by an injury in the spring. I didn’t run a step for the 30 days following the sprain, but every time I came down a bit too quickly on my left ankle, shockwaves of pain reverberated through my leg, and along with them came a resurgence of shame. 3 years of college training and the goals I had set for myself <em>freshman year</em> still eluded me. I was 0 for 6. If you would’ve shown current me to freshman year me, freshman year me may have cried and given up the sport, because, in his eyes, I had failed, and why keep trying if you don’t achieve what you wanted?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But, at least in my opinion, nothing could be further from the truth. I hadn’t failed, because somewhere along the line in the past three years, I stopped seeing success as binary. For 4 years in high school, I had viewed running as this perfectly linear system where, if you worked twice as hard, you improved twice as much. That meant that if you improved a lot and ran fast, then you had to be a hard worker, which means you deserved to be praised for your achievement. However, I had worked harder than ever for three years and had nothing to show for it. I hadn’t achieved success the way I had previously defined it, but somehow, aside from a few dark moments, I never felt like a failure, and I credit that to two lessons the Club had taught me. The first is that the Club forced me to take an active role in designing my own training, and hundreds of failed workout plans and ideas have taught me one thing; hard work doesn\'t yield results. <em>Smart hard work</em> and a bit of luck yields results. Smart runners listen to their body and balance running with the rest of their life to avoid overworking themselves, and understand that they can\'t go all out every day without burning themselves out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second lesson is far important, and it is that the Club taught me to love the <em>process </em>of training just as much as the fruits of training<em>. </em>I credit this to the wonderful, diverse group of people I’ve met on this Club in the past three years. I’ve met people who are born runners and those who have just found the sport. I’ve met those who have run on varsity teams and those who would never dream of it. I’ve met people who have hit adversity far greater than anything I’ve encountered, and people with perspectives on running that I had never considered. I had only ever viewed the running community as one that supported and accepted me because I was good at it, but until I joined Club I had never really believed that you could love the sport (or that the sport could love you) even when you weren’t competing at your best. The people on this Club push themselves to improve not because there is some guaranteed reward waiting for them at the end of their struggles, but because they <em>love doing it</em>. On top of all that, there are people who love running who don’t even want to compete, a concept which was completely foreign to me in high school. What ties this eclectic mass of runners of varying talents and backgrounds and passions together is not some desire for recognition or a constant drive to be the best athlete. What ties us together is that everyone on the Club, amidst thousands of other obligations with school and work and research and other social activities, manages to carve out some amount of time to run because <em>everyone appreciates running as something intrinsically valuable, regardless of their ability.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Within this melting pot for the past three years, I gradually changed the reasons why I ran. I had entered the Club completely focused on achieving arbitrarily defined goals of hitting certain times, getting certain places at meets, and being recognized as good enough for a varsity team. However, as time went on, each of those became less and less important to me. Sure, I still have some of those goals, and there’s nothing wrong with having them. However, achievement is only one flavor of the value that you can take from running. Yes, I still want to be an All-American this weekend and I’m going to run my legs into the ground to try and achieve that mark, but it whether I achieve that mark or not will not tarnish the incomparable joy I’ve experienced while training with this team. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\nappreciate the residual soreness that pulses through my legs as I get on to the\nbus to go to class after a morning workout. Watching the sun setting over the\nHotel after a late workout on the Engineering Fields brings me a special kind\nof peace. Seeing people show up to practice on a rainy, freezing afternoon when\nthey could be enjoying an afternoon nap warms my heart like nothing else. Rolling\nthrough College Park neighborhoods with a group of 15 shirtless dudes as we get\ncatcalled by bored kids sitting in traffic will never not be funny to me. The\nresults I want out of the sport still guide my training, but the result is not my\nsole motivator anymore. The act of running, whether you succeed or not, is a\nbeautiful gift all on its own, which is something you might forget when your\nseason doesn’t pan out the way you want it to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On another note, as deep as my love for running is, Club has helped me recognize that running is part of life, not its only facet. As I faltered in my attempts to hit my goals, as I spent entire months without an activity to which I ascribed so much of my self-worth and general well-being, as I gave up running in short bursts to focus on school or other activities and pursuits, I was forced to diversify who I was as a person because I couldn\'t rely on running to be my only source of self-worth anymore. I’m not just a runner, and nobody really is. I’m passionate about my career, about school, about my hobbies and so many other things, and those things coupled with uncountable other qualities make up who I am as a person, and the same goes for everyone else. Contrary to what I believed in high school, just because I wasn’t running well at the time didn’t mean I was any less valuable as a person. What’s great about Club is that everyone else understood that. There wasn’t something wrong with me because I wasn’t performing at a high-level all the time. I wasn’t shamed for not running fast when I wasn’t doing well, and that’s because the entire culture of the Club is designed around fitting running into your life when you can, not centralizing your life around it and fixating on those results. Every time I’ve walked away from the sport, I’ve come back and been welcomed by people who appreciate the multi-dimensionality of runners. Running is a big part of who we are, but it certainly isn’t the only part.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So,\nthis weekend, you may hit your goals, and you may not. What this Club has taught\nhigh school me is that those results do not define your worth, because no\nrunner is defined by their times, and no person is just a runner. After this\nweekend, you may resolve to pursue more ambitious goals next season, or you may\nchoose to move on to a different chapter in your life, one where running takes\na backseat to some other goal, whether it’s academic or social or career\noriented or whatever else. Regardless, what makes this Club special is that\nwhether or not you achieve your desired result does not determine the value of\nthe experience. So long as you appreciate the process of training and enjoyed\ngoing through it, so long as you can still look at running shoes with fondness\nand appreciate that you exercised your gift, then really, you’ve already got\nmore out of the <em>process</em> than the <em>result</em> could ever offer you. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I encourage anyone who is reading this, whether you’re competing this weekend or whether you compete at all, whether you’re running pain free or whether you’re icing an injury right now, or whether you’re frustrated by your season or living your wildest running dreams, to, like I’ve done in the past three years, examine yourself and ask why you’re doing any of this. Nobody is forcing you to run every day or spend your sparse free time on the weekends at meets. You’ve made the decision to devote yourself to running in some capacity, so there must be something core to your person that drives you to run, and reminding yourself of that reason every once in a while might be precisely what you need to reignite that passion that you may have overlooked while focusing on your desired result. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of you, like me, may be running your final cross-country race this weekend. Think back to that first ever cross-country race you ran, what’s made you stick around until now, and how far you’ve come since, not just as a runner, but as a person. Your motivations for sticking with the sport have morphed and changed alongside you as you’ve grown, and the fact that you’re here now means that there’s some passion in you that’s keeping you around.

I’ve learned to forgive myself when the results don’t go my way. <em>But, </em>I know for an absolute <em>fact</em> that the only thing I would never forgive myself for is running my final cross-country race, after 10 years of lacing up my spikes, without that passion and love for this beautiful sport burning in my chest through every step.

What if I used the weekly email platform for something more than just announcements? The benefits of spending more time preparing the email were twofold; if I put entertaining content in my emails, hopefully people would actually read them (or at least open them), <em>and</em>, maybe it would give people something to talk about with new people at practice. A well-crafted email, as trivial as it seemed, could serve not only as a vehicle to more effectively deliver important announcements, but also as a conversation starter to combat those silent runs when everyone has been so tired and busy that nobody has anything to talk about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, while wholly unnecessary and of my own volition, I stuck to it and spent an inordinate amount of time brainstorming how I could possibly write content that people would enjoy every week. Over the past year, I’ve churned out “inspirational sections” for almost every weekly email I’ve sent. Some of them were well thought-out reflections on contemporary issues in sports or profiles on exceptional athletes. Some were praises of accomplishments within our own community. When I really got busy with other things, some inspiration sections became shorter and more comedic than inspirational (you <em>bet</em> I wrote an inspirational section about our Med-Kit, fight me). Not all inspiration sections are created equal, but every week I tried to write something that would either get people excited about a week of practice, cheer people up after a hard week, or at the very least get a chuckle out of people on a slow Monday morning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However,\nthe more I wrote, as much as I liked subjecting my captive audience to my overdramatic\nwriting, I hit a tough realization. Like the writers of Game of Thrones, I was\nrunning out of material from which to draw content. The stakes of my posts were\nrising rapidly. I had gone from pulling up random comedic news articles to\ndoing extended write-ups of professional athletes who had achieved impossible feats.\nAfter proudly finishing up another inspiration section, my mood would\nimmediately flip: “How are you gonna build on this? How are you gonna go from\ntalking about running legends like Allyson Felix and Kipchoge to sharing a video\nof a cat falling out of a tree without dying, and expect people to still take\nyou seriously?” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\nmade it even harder on myself by doubling down when I ran out of time to write\none, promising that next week would be twice as good to make up for this week’s\ndisappointment. That brings us to this blog post, which is going to be way too\nlong for its own good. With Nationals six days in the future, I wanted to do\nsomething special, but at the same time I wanted it to be personalized and\nrelatable to those finishing up their seasons this weekend, <em>especially</em>\nfor those who will be rounding out their cross country careers this Saturday.\nThus, this week’s inspiration is going to be all about my experiences with\nMaryland Club Running, how it impacted my outlook on the sport for the better,\nand why I believe we should remind ourselves why we dedicate so much time to\nthe sport.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When\nI joined the Club three years ago, I had very similar thoughts on running that\nsome of the other competitive members of the club did. I was a pretty\naccomplished high school athlete that had not received an offer to run for a\ncollege team and, as a result, I felt slighted by the sport. I had spent four\nyears in high school pouring myself into my training to become as fast as I\ncould, with people telling me I was special the whole time. My coaches gave me extra\nattention, upperclassmen who I looked up to told me that I was going to be\nfaster than they were when I got to their age, and surges of pride coursed\nthrough me whenever a local running news source included my name in a write-up of\na recent meet. I set a pair of school records (both of which have since been\nshattered) and earned a couple medals and ribbons at championships. I loved the\nidea that people who I had never spoken to before knew who I was when I stepped\ninto a race, and I loved racing and showing off the results of my training and\ngetting recognized for my achievements. However, the absence of a college offer\nwounded my fragile, privileged, self-centered, Montgomery County relationship\nwith the sport. I wasn’t as talented as I thought I was. I wasn’t special, and\nI was not going to compete in the NCAA. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However,\nI wasn’t ready to accept being done with competition, so I decided to become a\nclub athlete. Joining the Club was going to be a brief blip in my competitive\nrunning career: a stepping-stone on my path to restore my old way of life. I\nwas going to wipe the floor with all the club competition and prove that I was\nsomething more than some club runner who peaked in high school. More than\nanything, I wanted to prove to myself that my efforts in high school running\nhad been worth something. I was going to run times that a varsity coach\ncouldn’t ignore, and I would move up to the varsity team and reclaim my\ntenuously defined self-worth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately for me, none of that happened. My path through college running was far less linear than I would have imagined, and I believe I’m better off for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I walked into my first cross country race with the Club and realized that I wasn’t even within the top seven runners on the team. I painted myself as some hot shot, D1 hopeful runner, and here I was getting smacked in <em>club</em> races. However, I re-doubled my efforts to get back into my old form, pumped up my mileage, and pushed myself to the wall on every interval workout. In the short term, it enabled me to achieve my goals. I finished 2<sup>nd</sup> place for the team at Nationals in Hershey that year, and I carried that momentum as I set my sights on track season, where I zeroed in on my first collegiate running goal: breaking 4 minutes in the 1500m. If you’ve ever heard me talk about track, you’d know that the sub-4 1500 is one of my longest held time goals. More importantly, you’d also know that I have not achieved it. Indeed, doubling your average weekly mileage (and doing all of it on concrete), doing extra interval workouts too early in your training cycle, and lifting weights improperly is a perfect recipe for a stress injury, and I had prepared it excellently. Two days after my first college track race, I could barely walk up and down the stairs to my dorm. My ill-advised training had damaged my left knee enough to keep me out of my entire freshman year of track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After\na long, sad semester of hobbling around campus and physical therapy, it was\ntime to get to work once again. I built my mileage slowly and deliberately in\nthe summer leading up to my sophomore year, focused solely on being a NIRCA\nAll-American in the fall. However, I ended up cutting my summer training short\nin August to go to Peru on a trip with Engineers without Borders, where\ntraining simply wasn’t feasible. After missing 3 weeks of training right before\nthe semester began, I had essentially wiped out the gains from my summer\ntraining and spent the fall building back up from scratch, resulting in what I\nwould call a mediocre season. Track was better. I set the club record in the\n1500m (albeit two seconds short of my 3:59 goal), plateaued very early in the\nseason, and underperformed at Nationals. It was alright, but I still hadn’t hit\nmy goals and was still left wanting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, I reacted to underperforming the way I had taught myself to react through 8 years of running; I doubled down again. I hit my highest mileage summer ever leading into junior year, albeit in a smarter fashion than I had done before my freshman track season (I did the extra strength training, got off the concrete and on to the trails, ate better, etc.). And, finally, it all seemed to pay off. I PR’d in the 8k by over 90 seconds and was on track to help the team with a historically high finish at Nationals. If you scroll back through this blog, you’ll find an even longer post of mine detailing exactly why that <em>didn’t </em>happen (TL;DR a large section of the team and I caught adenovirus two weeks before Nationals). After reading that essay, you may think “wow, this kid got really sad last year. There is no way he could possibly get sadder.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Surprise! After having a damn near perfect beginning to my junior track season, featuring my first major track victory at the Happy Valley 3k and a huge, 40 second 5k PR, I was closing in on yet another one of my goals: I was going to be All-American in the 5k. As I jogged to the track at 7AM on the Wednesday before Nationals to do a quick tune-up workout, I slipped off the sidewalk by the School of Public Health and inflicted astronomic levels of carnage on the tendons in my left ankle<em>.</em> As I write this, seven months after that sprain, my ankle has still not fully recovered. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It just wasn’t fair. I had done everything right this year. I hadn’t over-trained, I had done all the consistent work, and I had given everything I had in my races, only to be robbed <em>twice </em>in the same year of the achievements that I had worked toward for so long, bedridden by illness in the fall and hobbled by an injury in the spring. I didn’t run a step for the 30 days following the sprain, but every time I came down a bit too quickly on my left ankle, shockwaves of pain reverberated through my leg, and along with them came a resurgence of shame. 3 years of college training and the goals I had set for myself <em>freshman year</em> still eluded me. I was 0 for 6. If you would’ve shown current me to freshman year me, freshman year me may have cried and given up the sport, because, in his eyes, I had failed, and why keep trying if you don’t achieve what you wanted?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But, at least in my opinion, nothing could be further from the truth. I hadn’t failed, because somewhere along the line in the past three years, I stopped seeing success as binary. For 4 years in high school, I had viewed running as this perfectly linear system where, if you worked twice as hard, you improved twice as much. That meant that if you improved a lot and ran fast, then you had to be a hard worker, which means you deserved to be praised for your achievement. However, I had worked harder than ever for three years and had nothing to show for it. I hadn’t achieved success the way I had previously defined it, but somehow, aside from a few dark moments, I never felt like a failure, and I credit that to two lessons the Club had taught me. The first is that the Club forced me to take an active role in designing my own training, and hundreds of failed workout plans and ideas have taught me one thing; hard work doesn\'t yield results. <em>Smart hard work</em> and a bit of luck yields results. Smart runners listen to their body and balance running with the rest of their life to avoid overworking themselves, and understand that they can\'t go all out every day without burning themselves out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second lesson is far important, and it is that the Club taught me to love the <em>process </em>of training just as much as the fruits of training<em>. </em>I credit this to the wonderful, diverse group of people I’ve met on this Club in the past three years. I’ve met people who are born runners and those who have just found the sport. I’ve met those who have run on varsity teams and those who would never dream of it. I’ve met people who have hit adversity far greater than anything I’ve encountered, and people with perspectives on running that I had never considered. I had only ever viewed the running community as one that supported and accepted me because I was good at it, but until I joined Club I had never really believed that you could love the sport (or that the sport could love you) even when you weren’t competing at your best. The people on this Club push themselves to improve not because there is some guaranteed reward waiting for them at the end of their struggles, but because they <em>love doing it</em>. On top of all that, there are people who love running who don’t even want to compete, a concept which was completely foreign to me in high school. What ties this eclectic mass of runners of varying talents and backgrounds and passions together is not some desire for recognition or a constant drive to be the best athlete. What ties us together is that everyone on the Club, amidst thousands of other obligations with school and work and research and other social activities, manages to carve out some amount of time to run because <em>everyone appreciates running as something intrinsically valuable, regardless of their ability.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Within this melting pot for the past three years, I gradually changed the reasons why I ran. I had entered the Club completely focused on achieving arbitrarily defined goals of hitting certain times, getting certain places at meets, and being recognized as good enough for a varsity team. However, as time went on, each of those became less and less important to me. Sure, I still have some of those goals, and there’s nothing wrong with having them. However, achievement is only one flavor of the value that you can take from running. Yes, I still want to be an All-American this weekend and I’m going to run my legs into the ground to try and achieve that mark, but it whether I achieve that mark or not will not tarnish the incomparable joy I’ve experienced while training with this team. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\nappreciate the residual soreness that pulses through my legs as I get on to the\nbus to go to class after a morning workout. Watching the sun setting over the\nHotel after a late workout on the Engineering Fields brings me a special kind\nof peace. Seeing people show up to practice on a rainy, freezing afternoon when\nthey could be enjoying an afternoon nap warms my heart like nothing else. Rolling\nthrough College Park neighborhoods with a group of 15 shirtless dudes as we get\ncatcalled by bored kids sitting in traffic will never not be funny to me. The\nresults I want out of the sport still guide my training, but the result is not my\nsole motivator anymore. The act of running, whether you succeed or not, is a\nbeautiful gift all on its own, which is something you might forget when your\nseason doesn’t pan out the way you want it to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On another note, as deep as my love for running is, Club has helped me recognize that running is part of life, not its only facet. As I faltered in my attempts to hit my goals, as I spent entire months without an activity to which I ascribed so much of my self-worth and general well-being, as I gave up running in short bursts to focus on school or other activities and pursuits, I was forced to diversify who I was as a person because I couldn\'t rely on running to be my only source of self-worth anymore. I’m not just a runner, and nobody really is. I’m passionate about my career, about school, about my hobbies and so many other things, and those things coupled with uncountable other qualities make up who I am as a person, and the same goes for everyone else. Contrary to what I believed in high school, just because I wasn’t running well at the time didn’t mean I was any less valuable as a person. What’s great about Club is that everyone else understood that. There wasn’t something wrong with me because I wasn’t performing at a high-level all the time. I wasn’t shamed for not running fast when I wasn’t doing well, and that’s because the entire culture of the Club is designed around fitting running into your life when you can, not centralizing your life around it and fixating on those results. Every time I’ve walked away from the sport, I’ve come back and been welcomed by people who appreciate the multi-dimensionality of runners. Running is a big part of who we are, but it certainly isn’t the only part.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So,\nthis weekend, you may hit your goals, and you may not. What this Club has taught\nhigh school me is that those results do not define your worth, because no\nrunner is defined by their times, and no person is just a runner. After this\nweekend, you may resolve to pursue more ambitious goals next season, or you may\nchoose to move on to a different chapter in your life, one where running takes\na backseat to some other goal, whether it’s academic or social or career\noriented or whatever else. Regardless, what makes this Club special is that\nwhether or not you achieve your desired result does not determine the value of\nthe experience. So long as you appreciate the process of training and enjoyed\ngoing through it, so long as you can still look at running shoes with fondness\nand appreciate that you exercised your gift, then really, you’ve already got\nmore out of the <em>process</em> than the <em>result</em> could ever offer you. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I encourage anyone who is reading this, whether you’re competing this weekend or whether you compete at all, whether you’re running pain free or whether you’re icing an injury right now, or whether you’re frustrated by your season or living your wildest running dreams, to, like I’ve done in the past three years, examine yourself and ask why you’re doing any of this. Nobody is forcing you to run every day or spend your sparse free time on the weekends at meets. You’ve made the decision to devote yourself to running in some capacity, so there must be something core to your person that drives you to run, and reminding yourself of that reason every once in a while might be precisely what you need to reignite that passion that you may have overlooked while focusing on your desired result. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of you, like me, may be running your final cross-country race this weekend. Think back to that first ever cross-country race you ran, what’s made you stick around until now, and how far you’ve come since, not just as a runner, but as a person. Your motivations for sticking with the sport have morphed and changed alongside you as you’ve grown, and the fact that you’re here now means that there’s some passion in you that’s keeping you around.

I hopped on the running2win (RIP) bandwagon that summer as I wanted to take training more seriously to gear up for my first cross country season in two years. I couldn’t wait I was practically counting down the days until the first day of practice! I loved coming to practice; as someone who never spoke/had friends in classes at that point, it was my main socialization time. There was a string of three weeks that semester where I went to practice every single day, hardly possible for busy upperclassmen.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practices were HUGE that fall, or at least that’s what it seemed like. A ton of freshmen/transfers/new people in general showed up and seemed really committed to the club from the start. Two of those people were Shannon MacMaster and Julia Heiges, who are sitting in the living room with me as I type this (hi guys!). Anywho, the club was looking like it was really growing that fall! There were more girls running a variety of paces which made it easier to form training groups. I can recall doing multiple workouts with Kim Gerber, Olivia Sbrocco, and Rachel Norton that season and thinking how much better that was than the previous fall when I was constantly running by myself. Abby set a goal of bringing 20 girls to nationals that fall, and while we may not have reached that (we wound up bringing 16), we were starting to look like a REAL team!! Katrina and Luanne could not get over this and were especially proud after placing second at UVA that season.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kFCRM0Qm4v_A20FyHTXiQLfsqLk4TrJJKcdc5ePHjHpH6is0E1jTnemELHSj5z6a4iNMpaVuxmqeU1ASrDn2NC4LcO6BHablOj4Xndju_svpVnvIq5S86CpZYYsseEAUWMS9GcnT\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pz7mWAgLzf1Tg-xf2o75_iT2QtyskulzED3sbGinujvCjgWyws487-vV0jd0jAKAj16aYEmvGs4cWQMh_-KvJO8x_EEhWRr3k5H4S-a0J_BfYWAm9Vo2xy99GPSsw2yukC7DpSC\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>My first xc race with the club</strong>!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fall 2016 was an interesting season for me personally. I hadn’t run xc in two full years since I hadn’t raced with the club the previous fall and I had never run any 6k’s. I was able to “ease” back into it at NC State which was a 5k before being forced to run an extra thousand meters. I was always a bigger fan of shorter, flatter track races than I was of longer, more gruelingly hilly cross country races, but I had forgotten how tough xc courses could be on the body machine. NC State, which was reportedly a fast course, proved to be quite a challenge. I ran a disappointing mid 24 minute 5k, but overall the times seemed slower than everyone expected and it was our first meet of the season. The real test came the following weekend at Lehigh University’s Paul Short run. I’m not gonna lie, I don’t remember much about this race, maybe I blacked out, perhaps it’s because it was three years ago. I was advised to kick when I hit the toilet sculpture and so I kicked my way to an automatic pr of 28: in the 6k. I lamented barely breaking 29. Luckily there were meets a plenty that fall and I got another chance at a 6k the following week at UVA. Unfortunately, the results from UVA were somehow messed up and I don’t remember my time from that day so I can’t compare it to the week before but fortunately they attributed a faster time to my name! I did not run a 25:11 that day but I know I improved a little bit from Lehigh the week before. I can confirm the next race I ran was my fastest of the season, a 27:32 at regionals, a full minute faster than my last go round on that course! I felt like I was *starting to* get the hang of 6k’s, just in time for nationals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NATIONALS HYPE</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I couldn’t have been more excited for my first trip to nationals with the club. I had actually come close to signing up for nationals in the spring of my freshman year, but I thought it would be weird if the first meet I signed up for was <em>nationals, </em>plus I had a Friday morning lab that I didn’t want to have to make up. Hershey Park did seem like a nicer place to experience nationals for the first time than the University of Indiana. Little did I know (until I was informed by people that had run there in high school like Julia), that the course was not only mired in hills but polluted by the stench of poop thanks to its placement next to a waste management facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the somewhat disheartening course preview, I was still stoked. Just like I had for every meet that semester, I eagerly awaited for the travel email so I could memorize the car assignments, get that H20, read up on juicy meet information, and prepare for what would probably be the most memorable weekend of college thus far. Back in the days before I knew what exactly was going in the travel email before it was sent to the rest of the club, there were times when I would wake up in the middle of the night, check my email just to see if it was out yet (usually it was not), and go back to sleep.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the crisp morning of November 12<sup>th</sup>, we club runners (except Matthew “Clutch” “Clewless” Clewley who was running a bit behind schedule) hopped into our personal vehicles and made our way to Hershey, PA. My parents, and many other parents and a few doggies, also drove up/down/east/west to support us with a splendidly planned tailgate. I’m talking tons of FOOD! Homemade baked goods, grilled hot dogs and hamburgers, fruit, granola bars, fruit snacks that were placed on one sleepy boi, you name it—all kept safe under the cover of Tenty McTentleson &lt;3. I could only eye the food with longing, you see, as my race was the very last one of the day. I didn’t let this bother me too much (I stole some snacks for safekeeping in my bag) though because I had a jam-packed schedule of watching my teammates run in their respective races.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The day was off to a memetastic start with the men’s junior/senior/grad student race in which the Maryland men, led by Rob Kramer, absolutely crushed the mannequin challenge. More impressively, we then got to watch in awe as Rob went from last place to nearly medaling in the race while continuously stroking his “moustache.”&nbsp; Wanting to capture every moment, I ran from spot to spot on the course to snap pictures while cheering. Watching dozens of my teammates and hundreds of other NIRCA runners race was getting me anxious yet excited to finally make my nationals debut. We had a squad of <strong>five</strong> whole girls in the freshman/sophomore women’s race that afternoon, including my former roommate Eileen “the tank” Zohorsky. At long last, we five stripped down and got on the line to cap off the day of racing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider yourselves lucky if you get to race at Richmond this fall because the hills at Hershey were no joke. It was a constant cycle of trudging up then bounding down it made it hard to find a consistent, steady pace. Trying not to let anything get me down at my first nationals, I kept pushing the whole race and felt like I was running well—surprising considering how bad I am at running hills. I searched for something left to give one last kick up the final hill into the finishing straightaway. My time was 28:11, slower than my pr at regionals, but that didn’t matter. My smile stretched so wide it scrunched the corner of my NIRCA cheek tattoo.

This time I even had some company running with Rachel, Kim, and Olivia. The four of us were together for the first half of the race before I got left in the dust by Kim on that uphill bridge in the middle-ish part of the race. I just cannot do hills very well.

I hopped on the running2win (RIP) bandwagon that summer as I wanted to take training more seriously to gear up for my first cross country season in two years. I couldn’t wait I was practically counting down the days until the first day of practice! I loved coming to practice; as someone who never spoke/had friends in classes at that point, it was my main socialization time. There was a string of three weeks that semester where I went to practice every single day, hardly possible for busy upperclassmen.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practices were HUGE that fall, or at least that’s what it seemed like. A ton of freshmen/transfers/new people in general showed up and seemed really committed to the club from the start. Two of those people were Shannon MacMaster and Julia Heiges, who are sitting in the living room with me as I type this (hi guys!). Anywho, the club was looking like it was really growing that fall! There were more girls running a variety of paces which made it easier to form training groups. I can recall doing multiple workouts with Kim Gerber, Olivia Sbrocco, and Rachel Norton that season and thinking how much better that was than the previous fall when I was constantly running by myself. Abby set a goal of bringing 20 girls to nationals that fall, and while we may not have reached that (we wound up bringing 16), we were starting to look like a REAL team!! Katrina and Luanne could not get over this and were especially proud after placing second at UVA that season.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kFCRM0Qm4v_A20FyHTXiQLfsqLk4TrJJKcdc5ePHjHpH6is0E1jTnemELHSj5z6a4iNMpaVuxmqeU1ASrDn2NC4LcO6BHablOj4Xndju_svpVnvIq5S86CpZYYsseEAUWMS9GcnT\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pz7mWAgLzf1Tg-xf2o75_iT2QtyskulzED3sbGinujvCjgWyws487-vV0jd0jAKAj16aYEmvGs4cWQMh_-KvJO8x_EEhWRr3k5H4S-a0J_BfYWAm9Vo2xy99GPSsw2yukC7DpSC\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>My first xc race with the club</strong>!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fall 2016 was an interesting season for me personally. I hadn’t run xc in two full years since I hadn’t raced with the club the previous fall and I had never run any 6k’s. I was able to “ease” back into it at NC State which was a 5k before being forced to run an extra thousand meters. I was always a bigger fan of shorter, flatter track races than I was of longer, more gruelingly hilly cross country races, but I had forgotten how tough xc courses could be on the body machine. NC State, which was reportedly a fast course, proved to be quite a challenge. I ran a disappointing mid 24 minute 5k, but overall the times seemed slower than everyone expected and it was our first meet of the season. The real test came the following weekend at Lehigh University’s Paul Short run. I’m not gonna lie, I don’t remember much about this race, maybe I blacked out, perhaps it’s because it was three years ago. I was advised to kick when I hit the toilet sculpture and so I kicked my way to an automatic pr of 28: in the 6k. I lamented barely breaking 29. Luckily there were meets a plenty that fall and I got another chance at a 6k the following week at UVA. Unfortunately, the results from UVA were somehow messed up and I don’t remember my time from that day so I can’t compare it to the week before but fortunately they attributed a faster time to my name! I did not run a 25:11 that day but I know I improved a little bit from Lehigh the week before. I can confirm the next race I ran was my fastest of the season, a 27:32 at regionals, a full minute faster than my last go round on that course! I felt like I was *starting to* get the hang of 6k’s, just in time for nationals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NATIONALS HYPE</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I couldn’t have been more excited for my first trip to nationals with the club. I had actually come close to signing up for nationals in the spring of my freshman year, but I thought it would be weird if the first meet I signed up for was <em>nationals, </em>plus I had a Friday morning lab that I didn’t want to have to make up. Hershey Park did seem like a nicer place to experience nationals for the first time than the University of Indiana. Little did I know (until I was informed by people that had run there in high school like Julia), that the course was not only mired in hills but polluted by the stench of poop thanks to its placement next to a waste management facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the somewhat disheartening course preview, I was still stoked. Just like I had for every meet that semester, I eagerly awaited for the travel email so I could memorize the car assignments, get that H20, read up on juicy meet information, and prepare for what would probably be the most memorable weekend of college thus far. Back in the days before I knew what exactly was going in the travel email before it was sent to the rest of the club, there were times when I would wake up in the middle of the night, check my email just to see if it was out yet (usually it was not), and go back to sleep.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the crisp morning of November 12<sup>th</sup>, we club runners (except Matthew “Clutch” “Clewless” Clewley who was running a bit behind schedule) hopped into our personal vehicles and made our way to Hershey, PA. My parents, and many other parents and a few doggies, also drove up/down/east/west to support us with a splendidly planned tailgate. I’m talking tons of FOOD! Homemade baked goods, grilled hot dogs and hamburgers, fruit, granola bars, fruit snacks that were placed on one sleepy boi, you name it—all kept safe under the cover of Tenty McTentleson &lt;3. I could only eye the food with longing, you see, as my race was the very last one of the day. I didn’t let this bother me too much (I stole some snacks for safekeeping in my bag) though because I had a jam-packed schedule of watching my teammates run in their respective races.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The day was off to a memetastic start with the men’s junior/senior/grad student race in which the Maryland men, led by Rob Kramer, absolutely crushed the mannequin challenge. More impressively, we then got to watch in awe as Rob went from last place to nearly medaling in the race while continuously stroking his “moustache.”&nbsp; Wanting to capture every moment, I ran from spot to spot on the course to snap pictures while cheering. Watching dozens of my teammates and hundreds of other NIRCA runners race was getting me anxious yet excited to finally make my nationals debut. We had a squad of <strong>five</strong> whole girls in the freshman/sophomore women’s race that afternoon, including my former roommate Eileen “the tank” Zohorsky. At long last, we five stripped down and got on the line to cap off the day of racing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider yourselves lucky if you get to race at Richmond this fall because the hills at Hershey were no joke. It was a constant cycle of trudging up then bounding down it made it hard to find a consistent, steady pace. Trying not to let anything get me down at my first nationals, I kept pushing the whole race and felt like I was running well—surprising considering how bad I am at running hills. I searched for something left to give one last kick up the final hill into the finishing straightaway. My time was 28:11, slower than my pr at regionals, but that didn’t matter. My smile stretched so wide it scrunched the corner of my NIRCA cheek tattoo. I knew I had given it my best effort that day, and relative to other people whose times were around a minute slower on Hershey’s course than they were at Lehigh, I had done pretty well.

I was leading people on runs, bringing north campus freshmen to social events, and answering new people’s questions about the club. I still felt pretty new to the club, but I guess I was becoming more of a leader and feeling like one too. That winter break, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the NIRCA winter conference in Boston with Dolf, Briggs, Ethan, Katrina and Hiro. I was the only non-officer in attendance and I had a great time and gained more of an appreciation for NIRCA and for the club sphere. I had a chance to voice my opinions (while Harry from UPenn stopped talking for five seconds) about the direction NIRCA is going in and plans for future nationals and make connections with other club runners. There was even one runner from BU’s club team there that I knew from XC camp in high school that I got to see! My further involvement in club and NIRCA happenings solidified my status as a truly involved member of the club.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that my first full season of training and racing with the club was complete after a brief hiatus from competition post-high school, I thought I would be primed to have a successful season of running that spring. Key word thought. Not much progress was made that season. I was running everyday and doing all the workouts, but it just didn’t feel like my overall fitness was really improving. It seemed like every run was a struggle to finish-even the easy ones. I could do an easy short run and somehow feel like I had just done the hardest run of my life. The only good thing about doing workouts was listening to Luanne count down the reps: “Only 3 more til we’re halfway done!” “Only 2 more until we’re halfway to being halfway done!” “Only one more until we’re at the countdown!” (the countdown being 3-2-1). While Luanne’s enthusiasm during workouts was certainly helpful, it wasn’t changing the fact that I felt so tired after practice everyday. I didn’t really understand it, but nonetheless kept training.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Racing wise, spring of 2016 was very random and sporadic. It was also the season where I was afraid of the mile/1500. I opened the season with the one and only indoor meet for us, the Happy Valley Invitational. It was an exciting atmosphere with a nice track. We also brought a nice helping of girls to run. We had enough for two whole women’s DMRs!!&nbsp; Being that many of my teammates had specific legs they wanted to run and that I was also afraid of running anything moderately long because of how slow my time would be, I filled in as the 400 leg. A nice and (relatively) quick and fun two laps around the oval was an easy way to open the track season. It’s not like my 400 split mattered that much‒I never even found out what it was. I took a brief cooldown outside and waited for my next race, the open 800. I ran a very unremarkable time in the open 8 later as the lactic acid took over my muscles, but I thoroughly enjoyed being at the meet and racing. It was the first of the season and there was still plenty of time for improvement.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next opportunity for racing didn’t come until club Penn Relayz (I missed UMBC earlier in the season) at historic Franklin Field. Everyone that had been to club Penn Relayz before raved about it-the pick your own batons, the distance runners doing 4x1s, the shot glasses as prizes--so I, and everyone else, was very excited for this meet! One difference this year though was that the meet was moved from late April to late March and that made for some way chillier temperatures for race day. Some wonderful parents came to support us anyway though, including mine and Julia’s. Penn Relayz, as the name indicates, is the ideal time to partake in some relays. I decided to do just that, running in a swedish medley relay and a 4x4. I also originally signed up for the open mile, but like I mentioned earlier I was afraid of the mile and how could I risk tiring myself out when I had some very important sprint races to do! According to Britney, our then sprint captain, I actually did a really good blind handoff in our swedish relay and we creamed the only other team in the race so it was worth it. I had earned myself a club Penn Relayz shot glass! Except they did not have any to give out that year and we were all under the impression that we would be receiving some after winning all the races. No surprise that we haven’t gone back to that meet since.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spring track nationals was only a few weeks after club penn. After having the time of my life at xc nats, I was so ready for another jam-packed NIRCA weekend. My van consisted of Luanne, Briggs, Jonathon Shinholt, and Kirk Morris, a good mix of sprinters/distance and people who I knew and didn’t really know. Would this be my chance to hear life stories and tell my own?! I hoped so. It was still pretty cold when we left that early April morning. In fact, when I took the second shift driving the van starting in Cumberland, MD, IT STARTED SNOWING. <em>Wtf</em> I thought <em>why did this have to start as soon as I took the wheel? </em>I clutched the steering wheel for dear life while we slowly inched up some mountainous terrain. Kirk generously offered to take over driving, but I couldn’t bear the shame of pulling over on the side of the road and switching back to the passenger seat after a five minute shift. I just had to take it r e a l&nbsp; s l o w. Of course we had also merged into a one lane road so I was now backing up cars behind me with one of those cars being one of our vans where Trey was complaining about my driving without knowing it was me.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I managed to make it through a two-hour stint behind the wheel without causing any accidents or near death experiences this time thankfully. Our car was getting <strong>very </strong>anxious to finally make it to Indiana, though we managed to keep ourselves entertained with the glorious emergence of NIRCA Snaps. Anything was, and still is, fair game for NIRCA snaps&nbsp; All you have to do is insert the word NIRCA in front of another word/phrase to make it instantly cool and worthy of being shared on a snapchat story to hundreds of people. We NIRCA athletes have very high standards of course. Also butt chugging was very important (at least to Rob).&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We finally arrived at what was definitely the nicest lodging we’ve ever stayed in as a club. I wish I remembered the name of it so I can stay there in the future when I go to Indiana (HA), but actually it was very log cabin-y in a nicer, more modern way. There was a super nice outdoor fire pit area where we roasted marshmallows on Saturday night while Ethan was on the verge of body slamming Trey in a sleeping bag. 5/5 stars. I got a nice and cozy rest wedged in between Shannon and Katrina in our possibly queen sized bed before getting up to go cheer on Norf Norf in the Hoosier half marathon. We camped out by the Indiana frat/sorority houses as our first cheering spot. I only feel the need to mention that because the houses were absolute MANSIONS and they all had unique designs.They put Maryland’s houses to shame. Cheering for the marathon with Dolf, Ethan, Luanne, and Marcel was without a doubt my favorite part of that weekend. It was just an all around great atmosphere with good vibes and supportive runners-a splendid way to start track nationals.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile everyone else was gearing up for a long day of races at the track. We kicked off the day with the 4x800 relay. One of my best friends from high school was also running the 4x8 for Purdue’s running club but in the slow heat (lame). Nevertheless, it got me even more excited to race that day. Katrina, Luanne, Shannon and I warmed up and stretched together, while watching the slow heat. Before starting, we gathered for a pre-race huddle and got photographed by NIRCA’s official photography crew, one of my most cherished pictures from a club event.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Katrina led off strong and passed the baton to me on the second leg. As usual, I went out at a pace that I couldn’t keep up and slowed down a lot on the second lap. My time was somewhere in the high 2:40s, not what I was hoping for on the big stage. Shannon and Luanne held their own for the next two legs and helped us to an eleventh place finish and a new women’s club 4x8 record! I was glad to have my team to rely on and carry me to the only club record I would ever be a part of (until it was broken the next year at nationals). I had another 800 to run later on much more fatigued legs and only just managed to break three minutes. I almost always ran significantly worse in my second event of the day in high school and this was no different. The disappointing times didn’t bother me though since I was having such a good time overall with the team at our biggest meet of the season. The rest of the day was spent chilling and watching races, mainly while laying in the grass with Luanne and Katrina making guesses on what times our guys would run in their 1500s.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZthaBVgnzri6XM962T55GDUAp28YvPcDpSqHO3Q75Hj2i-pJmHK79WxmYQihavmr6CKaCtP9yY2aHE7HrTIYY8DogBDtNCQJw8k7CHfxFb5BtID8r6p7SlvvEgRB7BQrfNUid23j\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CQe1W-y2ivWLiQQALfQ4YlOnXGhjQVLgfs1ibcq8EDhLnsjT06jZWspmWWREkwQSL1zsbUrowFt3ARnq6Y-SLf239UQqfAvRLSZ0_ghK7MCgziMuGUAorA1dEPlfyUH9R8ktVnDa\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hGnT71Esmk-YnJwSAwH1ecSj2utovL9ipkaSfsXFRJhxom-44vIHOgN_pZHoYjXlZwhR5w80akaK3yRPYlUfbsRTvVbZ7tFdreJVfl2OhFD9s2GS_XdTNBXGD3TJijf6UUOJ7lrs\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Target in Indiana hits different</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later that night we had an...interesting dinner at what was essentially a fast food restaurant but for pasta. The cashier was sketchily pulling mass produced salads out from under the counter and the manager was offering us endless breadsticks. The most interesting part though was that Rob’s dad, who had traveled with him out to Indiana, joined us for the meal. Afterwards, my car took an eventful trip to target where Dolf and Ethan argued over whether to get Patsy (the birthday boy) a birthday cake and eventually settled on some butterfly shaped pastries and s’mores supplies. With stomachs full of questionable dietary choices, we tucked ourselves into bed before the second and final day of spring track nationals.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Day two got underway immediately as everyone was trying to get the heck out of Indiana and back home before class on Monday morning. The big event for me (and Katrina, Shannon, and Luanne) that day was the women’s 1500, and I distinctly remember none of us wanting to do it. My excuse was that I had a feeling I would run slow after seeing my times from the day before. Also, I was legitimately afraid of running a 1500/mile. I hadn’t done one since spring track counties my senior year of high school, and that was one of the worst, saddest races I had ever run. I didn’t ever want to relive that race, so I stayed away. It made me feel better knowing that the other girls were all considering scratching except, my fear and doubts getting the best of me, I was the only one that actually wound up scratching. The culminating event, like at most track meets, was the 4x4. Katrina, Luanne, Shannon and I reconvened once more to #squadup for the relay (funny how that happens when only five girls sign up for a meet), this time more focused on just having fun. After all, this was NIRCA and there were girls in our heat racing in flannels and backwards baseball caps calling it the “4 by fun.” I was very here for the 4 by fun, in fact I think that should be the mindset everyone has about running a 4x4. With that in mind, we smiled our way through 1600m of pure Nirca joy to cap off the weekend. Obviously that race was my favorite one that I ran that weekend. It helped that there was absolutely no pressure!&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hit the road, one “rush back” car actually having left first thing that morning, ready for the long journey back to College Park, but not quite ready to go back to school and the real world. I had a very intimate car ride home consisting of deep life talks late into the night with Briggs, Luanne, Dolf and Shinholt. THIS was the true nationals van experience I had heard so much about. Admittedly, I fell asleep at some point during the second half of the drive and woke up who knows how long later—except I pretended to still be asleep because I didn’t want to partake in the deep life convos at that time. I eavesdropped still half asleep from the very back row of the van. Yes, I am the worst, but I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about myself at the time and no one should feel pressured to. My time would come. Soon. Finally, we arrived in good ole CP in the wee hours of the morning, returned the vans, and crawled into bed, hopefully after taking a shower. Nationals may have been over but the season still wasn’t!<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next meet on the calendar was at Hopkins the weekend immediately after nationals. It was a Friday meet with some great DIII competition, but since it was on a Friday and that was back when I still had Friday classes, I had to forgo it for the sake of my academics. The Hopkins meet was followed by a weekend off before we returned to Shippensburg University for the Paul Kaiser Classic. Ahh, Shippensburg, where I made my return to racing just a year before. This time, I signed up for the 3000m steeplechase. Steeple was huge in New York and I had been dying to try steeple since freshman year of high school. I didn’t think I was good enough to do it as a freshman, though, so I never asked my coach to put me in it. I wanted to get better at running in general before attempting to run with barriers and water jumps. By the time I felt ready to try it senior year of high school and asked my coach about it, he said we needed to “get me healthy first.” For context, I missed the beginning of that spring season because of injury and I guess I never got healthy enough for my coach to let me try steepling. Alas, part of the beauty of club running is that you have the freedom to sign up for whatever the heck you want (@Shannon and Julia in the shot put) without having to get it okayed with a coach, and it was steeple time.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I practiced some barrier jumps that week during practice. Thanks to my time as a hurdler in middle school, I was able to clear the barriers with ease and didn’t suddenly get scared when approaching them like some people do. The women’s steeple that day at Ship only had five entrants—three of which were me, Eileen, and Rachel. I had a lot of fun trying out a new event that day, although I wished I ran it a little bit faster. I may have been the worst at running in that race (I finished 4th out of 4 after one girl dropped), but according to the spectators, I was the best at the hurdling part which gave me a sense of accomplishment. On another note, we had an absolute squad of girls at Ship that day, most of which were underclassmen. Now that we had such a solid it was exciting to think where the club would continue to go on the girl’s side in the future. Not only were we running with each other, but we were becoming good friends with each other too! The night before Shippensburg, eight of us bussed over to the tattoery, still sweaty from practice, and got some ear piercings. That will forever be one of the best bonding experiences I’ve had with the club girls. I loved the spontaneity of it. Unfortunately, that is an expensive tradition to keep up and we would all eventually run out of piercings that we want to get, so we have not had a team piercing trip since. Maybe the next generation of club girls can bring it back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BC69mna_9h8oxNhB-MryAD_-Id4bsTaPdYEVhGGAGCF0LnLscUsYxjXmLGmJPJNJxyGNCUnUCmlGd23lYY_0AIaXi-iRyAeuU6dUUirKxEWLUI39Z5mVYrxKgqCp8CyYztzo4AdE\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JDLi7VFa-00WlUH30bjmiWbS0fy-DMCMkqGeDDE5eyjivCITyq8q8NqDCSmnMl6fOTRo3OYj-b2wSyuFDSpoXrxxhebajimSTKF1INh0ySgoP5SvWFQhRNIzRYuHFx1S6GbgMjWR\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Absolute SQUAD</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With that race in the books, my weird season with inconsistent racing, absent fitness, and a lingering feeling of fatigue was over. I was extremely ready for a break after Ship. As much as I loved running Frederick freshman year, there was absolutely no way my body could handle 13.1 miles, even if I took it easy. It was time for a much needed break before gearing up for a fresh season of cross country. Funnily enough, when we were talking about who had signed up for the half at practice one day, Luanne was surprised to find out that I hadn’t. She just assumed I did because I signed up for almost about everything with the club! I was flattered and pleased that in a year I had gone from a random, quiet girl that people did not think would stick around to a consistent and devoted club member that people had come to expect to be around all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Outside of racing and competing, there were still plenty of fun things to do with the club that spring, like underclassmen dinners (did somebody say smoothie tower?), volunteering at kehoe, playing intramurals (one of my favorite aspects-more later!!!), and other end of semester extracurricular activities I enjoyed spring ‘17 a lot despite not having a single good race, speaking more to the beauty of club running. Even when you’re not at your best, being around the team and the good vibes surrounding it is enough to make what seems like a failure of a season into a successful, fun, and memorable one. Season 4/8 taught me to appreciate the little things and not fixate on your own personal failures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"width\":585,\"height\":438} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OuDhJK6GuY5uRPSwhaAJR63EWoGKXE7YtCHYoiyElcKD9oldQwDttogRBFJe51P__AYAKW378WdnYxmBKifkbMML4KKwLWPQ_4LmVGUg1C-CaxbbDyy4py4jsxaMyfaCuugnBsg_\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"438\" /><figcaption>Reaching our smoothie tower destiny</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->', 'My Journey Through Club Running: Part 4', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '416-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-11-29 22:43:21', '2019-11-30 03:43:21', '', 416, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/416-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

As a scrawny sophomore, I still wore white knee-length compression shorts under my uniform split shorts because the sight of my own thighs crippled me with anxiety. Even as an insecure 15-year-old, nothing instilled confidence in myself more than my running. The sweet spot of my career, that first year when you start taking your training seriously and it pays off, had begun. I PR’ed in almost every race I entered as a sophomore and looked towards my first state championship unfazed by the challenge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As such, when my two coaches huddled my team in a science classroom after practice a few days before the state meet to give us a pep talk, I almost fell asleep. I didn’t need any extra motivation. Why would I? Running was simple; you show up, you do your best, and your best comes out. The ignorance borne of youth and absence of adversity made me invincible. Why were we taking an extra twenty minutes to “inspire” ourselves after practice when I could be studying for pre-calc or playing <em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em>? (My time was precious, you see).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When my coach began reading us an excerpt from some popular running book, I rolled my eyes and checked out. How could anyone possibly write an entire book about something so mundane, so easy, and so mind-numbingly singular? Three days later, further supporting my theory that I knew everything and had figured out the secrets of life at 15 years old, I ran a PR at the state championship and earned a top 25 medal. Running’s easy, keep your books to yourself!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Six years, four major injuries, and countless heartbreaking workouts and disappointing races later, I saw myself preparing for my last collegiate track season a tad fed up with running poorly. A novel idea arose; maybe my incredibly experienced coach knew what she was talking about. Whilst shopping for Christmas presents, I figured I’d splurge on a little something for myself: a copy of John Parker Jr.’s <em>Once a Runner, </em>the very story I discounted six years prior. Many runners hail Parker’s novel as “the best book ever written about running” (it says that on the cover though, so the critical thinker in me took that with a fist-sized grain of salt). Maybe I had been missing some secret this whole time, and somewhere in 250 pages lay some sentiment that would electrify the end of my collegiate running career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a week, this book melted my skepticism. I was in love. The way Parker created a fictional world of a collegiate distance runner that felt realer than anything was like nothing I had ever read before. This book <em>understood me</em>. Everything from the pre-race jitters to the unspoken politics of track teams, from the annoyance of being constantly confused with “health-nuts” to the subtle unease of skipping a training day, and most importantly, the constant drive to improve and the mysterious, unnameable source of that drive, was <em>there</em> and expressed succinctly, almost poetically. It was as if some distant, unknown cousin came for a surprise visit and started showing me grainy photographs of long-lost family members resembling me. Parker’s book was new to me and from a completely different time, but at the same time the little touches that adorned every aspect of his world felt eerily familiar, like I had seen them a thousand times over without ever bothering to put a name to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a quick account of the book hopefully low on spoilers, Parker, a former mile champion himself, pens a fictional tale of an avatar of himself: Quenton Cassidy, a talented, self-deprecating yet delightfully cocky miler entering his senior year in Florida’s fictional Southeastern University in the early 70’s. The book takes a simultaneously irreverent and deadly serious look inside Cassidy’s mind as he prepares for his final year of track. Unfortunately, for reasons I’ll not disclose here, Cassidy, in the shape of his life, gets banned from competition in the spring. In the midst of a challenge completely unrelated to running, Cassidy faces a choice: change his lifestyle completely in order to continue his pursuit of running perfection, or accept the hand dealt to him and walk away quietly to a life without competitive running. If you could guess, he chooses the former, isolates himself in a desolate cabin in the woods, and triples his efforts in pursuit of becoming the perfect miler.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This book lit my soul on fire in January, and that flame warded me against laziness and the winter’s cold. The simplicity and ferocity with which I trained returned to 15-year-old me levels. Running was still the inherently simple, and sometimes painfully mundane task it was six years ago, but I could love it all the same because this book reawakened my passion for that simplicity. This was my last track season, and thanks to Parker and Cassidy, it would be explosive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That is, it <em>would have been</em> had the world not ceased its rotation before spring break. Alas, like many seniors around the country, the track season I thought to be my magnum opus no longer existed. While this is not meant to be some self-obsessed account of why this pandemic specifically harms <em>me,</em> an upper-middle class college student with no health problems or compromised family members, hopefully you can understand and relate to my disappointment, if only a little bit. Running’s purist beauty, after two months, became poisoned with extraneous hardships and complexity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Faced with the similar choice as Cassidy, I wasn’t ready to quit in the face of adversity. I was in great shape, the product of four months of excellently consistent training and four years of equally consistent suffering. Why stop now? My valiant quarantine training commenced! I scheduled a time trial with my roommates. I held the intensity of my training afloat as best I could with a growing tidal wave of apathy lurking in the background. This was simply another test, right? Just as Cassidy states during a particularly difficult bout of overtraining, “from the crucible of such inner turmoil comes the various metals, soft or brittle, flawed or pure, that determine the good runners, the great runners, and perhaps the former runners.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Loosely translated; if you don’t keep training just because your precious little season got cancelled, you’re a fraud. Quarantine hadn’t changed running, just everything else around it. The bleachers had been stripped of your audience, your efforts lost the promise of medals and ribbons, and your training lost the levity brought by training partners. Running is still there though, and if you don’t love it at its worst, you don’t deserve it at its best *<em>vomits*.</em> Your training should have the same, nay, double the intensity it did before or else you weren’t a true believer, just some tourist experimenting with the life of a true runner for a couple years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Curiously enough, I’m a fraud. Physically poised to run a 5k time-trial that I thought would be the first of a lengthy “Quarantine Racing Series,” I toed the line at the track one March afternoon feeling oddly tired, and just a bit bored. A tad over 2k in, that boredom evolved to intolerable discomfort and crushing disinterest, so I stepped of the track, sat in the sandpit, and untied my spikes. Four days later, I couldn’t imagine keeping up any form of training, and declared a hiatus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Confused, frustrated, and just plain <em>tired</em>, I picked <em>Once a Runner</em> off my desk to try and rekindle the spark. This book is a cult classic beloved by millions. It couldn’t be meaningless, could it? There had to be something in this fiction that was real, irrefutable, and constant: some golden truth that I needed to reconsult to give my struggle meaning again. This time, I read closer, scrutinizing themes and ideas more deeply than the first time around. I even wrote down important quotes accompanied by page numbers (<em>please clap).</em> I left not disappointed, but with a wildly different impression. Without giving too much away for any of you who haven’t read it (a condition I still think you should fix), I left the second read with three key flaws in the book I previously thought perfect. After a brief online search, it seems that these criticisms aren’t anything new. So, to summarize those flaws:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>This book glorifies overtraining.</strong> When I brought up the superhuman volume of Cassidy’s training to my roommate, he countered with “It was the 70’s man, everybody trained like that.” Upon my first read, yes, Cassidy’s constant 140-mile weeks (in preparation to race a <em>mile,</em> mind you) stood out as ridiculous. However, upon a second read, the issue runs deeper than a miler doing double the necessary mileage. When Cassidy begins suffering physically from increasing his mileage (sleeping 14 hours a day, eating poorly, feeling depressed and irritable, ignoring his girlfriend, and skipping class) he throws out some macho 9<sup>th</sup> grade one-liners about how overtraining is a necessary part of the process: Cassidy’s “Trial of Miles.” The book presents an uncompromising message towards training. The “secret” to success is running a lot, pretty fast (about 6 min/mile), twice every day, without any days off. If you can’t commit to that, you suck and you’re wasting your time. Cassidy’s idol and coach, Bruce Denton, runs twice a day through a sickness that leaves him bedridden and puking for the rest of the day. Cassidy trains similarly and never suffers an injury or underperforms in a race (his slowest mile race in the book is about 4:03). How convenient. Cassidy’s infamous interval workout (which lies in one of the best written chapters so I won’t spoil what it is), demands paces and volume that make a training montage from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> look realistic. Cassidy, Denton, and their teammate Jerry Mizner, train like insufferable morons for the entire book. Don’t read this looking for training advice.</li><li><strong>This book’s main theme has sexist undertones. </strong>When I first read this book, I saw some of the sexism in it and wrote it off. It’s set in the Deep South in the 70’s, so I expected some of it. But I’m not talking about how the school football coach is a womanizer (his name is Dick Doobey, I’d be surprised if he wasn’t), nor am I talking about how the jocks single out “ugly girls” to cheat off of during exams, or about that bizarre, glancing sentence where Cassidy kisses a random nurse on the forehead before sprinting away and we’re supposed to think he\'s some charming rogue for it. I don’t mind the first two because the football establishment and its members are villains and villains are prone to, well, villainy. The third is obnoxious, and there’s loads of minuscule, one-off sentences like it where a woman is reduced to “a sweet thing” or some other outdated one-liner that could have been omitted without any consequence to the story. The larger, possibly unforgivable offense lies in the writing of Cassidy’s girlfriend Andrea, the only female character given more than ten lines of dialogue. Andrea spends the book trying to understand Cassidy and his spiritual desire to test his limits, but she can’t. Why? Because Parker finds his only female character more useful as an obstacle than a support. Andrea exists solely to provide a running-free foil to Cassidy in his running-centric world. She symbolizes a distraction, not evil but frivolous, something that obstructs Cassidy’s pursuit of athletic prowess. It’s no coincidence Parker wrote Andrea with a limp. She’s written as an earthbound pedestrian trying desperately to understand space flight. She gets reduced to a trial that Cassidy must overcome, because how could the pursuit of greatness <em>ever</em> be understood by <em>*gasps* </em>a <em>woman</em>?</li><li><strong>This book’s specificity can be alienating. </strong>Just as Andrea, a non-runner, gets blown sideways in the wake of Cassidy’s fast-track to glory, so too does anyone running for any reason other than winning races. Parker periodically digs at hobby joggers, fitness junkies, “spiritual” or “zen” runners, and anyone else with less than pie-in-the-sky goals. Parker intended this book for competitive runners, and with that comes some elitism and exclusivity. Cassidy’s internal monologue mirrors Parker’s intent: if you’re not “all or nothing”, you’re nothing.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So “the greatest book ever” presents some issues. It’s uncompromising, exclusive, and, shockingly, fictional. What then, draws so many to the tale of Quenton Cassidy? He’s not exactly the most relatable protagonist. He <em>begins</em> the book with a blistering mile PR of 4 minutes. He’s respected, clever, funny, unyieldingly ambitious and, for the most part, invincible. He’s basically a running Superman, and Superman’s perfection makes him less popular than heroes with character flaws. Why do runners look at Cassidy like a kindred spirit, when a fraction of a fraction of them possess the talent and drive to exist in his upper echelon of “real runners?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think the answer is simple. I think that every competitive runner, fast, slow, young, old or injured has either possessed or dreamed of possessing Cassidy’s drive at some point. Heck, forget just runners. Anyone who dreams of being great at anything wishes they could be Cassidy, if only for a little while. He’s a man who gives up everything in pursuit of greatness, and that image is tantalizing. Everyone’s thought it. What if I dropped everything and wrote music all day? What if I quit school to start a business? What if I moved to a cabin in the woods and ran like a madman every day? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s a simple idea, removing distractions to maximize your potential, and in the world of fiction our heroes rarely deal with a scenario where it doesn’t pay off because that would spoil the romance. It’s also an idea toyed with by many runners entering this quarantine. With the world closed and commitments shut down, I’ve seen people all over Strava embrace the “all-in” mentality. But for every runner I see busting out ridiculous mileage borne out of boredom, I see another like myself: unmotivated, guilty, and nostalgic for the season that never happened. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In March, we were kicked into isolation that Cassidy chose voluntarily. Some of us adjusted famously. Some took a step back or even stopped training altogether. According to Cassidy, only the former type deserves respect. The rest should be ashamed, and from what I read on Strava while skipping Zoom lectures, many of us are just that: ashamed. When I dropped out of my own time trial four weeks ago I felt acute self-loathing that eventually smoothed out into remorseful frustration which then fizzled into a quiet dissatisfaction that still lingers. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’d argue that the final of those three qualities is the most useful for fueling a <em>real</em> running journey, one with all the warts and blemishes absent from Cassidy’s pristine journey. I liken self-loathing to an intense dehydration, where you want something so dearly, so <em>immediately</em>, that you’ll do anything to drink some damn water, even if you hurt yourself (not just physically) in the process. On the other hand, quiet dissatisfaction is more like the hunger in the middle of a day when you’ve forgotten to pack a lunch. The slow, smoldering embers of the latter are far more likely to keep you warm and carry you further, while the blazing inferno of the former will burn and burn and burn until you’ve got nothing left but ashes and a hatred for your sport and yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’ve held to a strict training regimen in the midst of all this chaos, bravo. If instead you wake up in the middle of a global health pandemic without the intense, roiling desire to train your guts out with no races on the near horizon and no teammates to pal around with, and worse, feel <em>guilty</em> about not having the drive anymore, <em>that’s okay.</em> Because, at the risk of Quenton Cassidy rising out of my book and smacking me across the face, it’s okay to not be “all-in” all the time. You can fulfill yourself without Cassidy’s furious obsession.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Deep down, everyone <em>wants </em>their running career to be Cassidy-esque even if they haven’t read the book. What you might forget when you’re caught up in either the book or your own head after a failed workout, is that more than just <em>gumption </em>separates you from Cassidy. Rather, you could train with the same ferocity and single-mindedness he does and still come up short. That’s a result of living in the <em>real world</em>, where injuries are real, overtraining is real, <em>you</em> are real, and where <em>global health pandemics</em> are real. In this real world, though you may be isolated like second-half Quenton Cassidy, there\'s no need to adopt his \"do-or\"die\" lifestyle as well, t’s okay to be first-half Quenton Cassidy, who pulls pranks, who leads an exciting love life, who gets his training in but is willing to adjust so he can enjoy the weekends with his friends (though I suppose you shouldn’t be doing that last one). Don’t obsess, just live your life the way you want and let the running come naturally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nevertheless, I can still love this book <em>and</em> forgive myself for taking a break from my training during quarantine, and that’s because the magic of <em>Once a Runner</em> lies not in its social commentary or utility as a training guide. If that were true, you’d see competitive runners spitting on joggers out on the sidewalk whilst training themselves to death, and almost all of them would still end up unsatisfied with their own lives because not all of them could be the best. Bleak, right? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Once a Runner</em>’s timeless power, the power that draws emotion out of so many, is the vivid life it brings to the unspoken laws and details that litter the corners of our lives. Cassidy sleeps in his running clothes to save extra time in the morning and yet he <em>still</em> despises every second of waking up for a run. He and his teammates give their routes goofy names and talk ridiculous hypotheticals to pass the time while running. He’s got every pair of spikes he’s ever raced in saved in a box under his bed, each with their own stories. Knowing that millions of people understand what it’s like to spend your day doing something so simple without imagining doing it any differently, knowing that they understand<em> that</em> alongside every other minuscule habit that links us all together gives this tale the power to tell the reader “you’re not alone,” even when we’re all locked away in our own corners of the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read the book if you’re interested. Forgive yourself if you’re not killing it on the trails now.

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and most of the summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the injury I was able to avenge myself from the year before. I signed up for the same open race where my former high school team was to compete later. This year my former coach was hurt, unable to participate, and my friend could not make it back from college. To make up for it all three of my siblings were in town, so I was feeling the pressure to perform. It was the first time my older brother had seen me race and my younger brother, who had just started high school cross country, was due to race later. Thanks to the confidence and love for running I had gained in my short time with the club, I was able to have a very successful race. I came in fourth, it should have been third but the guy in front of me cut the course, with a new modest PR of 17:20 on the same course which I had failed miserably last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, weird change in writing but here it goes. I wrote the next paragraph at 3 in the morning and I was in a pretty deep place. But I liked it, so I kept it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It felt good to be back to where I was in high school, but thanks to the club that doesn’t have to be the end. The motivation I feel from the club to push myself everyday to be the best person I can be is extraordinary. This drive is not limited to running. I feel it in academics, social life, and in just being a nice person. When I joined Maryland club running this was the type of environment I hoped to find. We motivate, help, joke, and have fun with each other. While right now it seems the hole we are in is being filled with sand and there is no way out. One thing we still have is each other. We must continue to motivate each other to be the best we can be. When this is all over life will not be the same. Opportunities, major life events, and memories destined to happen will not be there, but there is one thing that will have changed for the better. You. You will have kept your head high and continued to work on bettering yourself, because when times get tough that\'s when you really grow as a person. So, yes everything sucks it sucks so much, but we can take this as an opportunity to grow because we still have one another to support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While my time with the club has been short it has grown into one of the most meaningful things in my life. I look forward to going to practice everyday and I have found a genuine love for running, more so than I ever thought I did. I appreciate all the people who have made and continue to make the club what it is today.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10 / Tennessee</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will open the recap of the Tennessee trip by thanking everyone for the great time, especially those who helped organize it. As someone who basically had no hiking experience this was an amazing trip. On top of all the music, food, running, hiking, and coffee my favorite part was getting to know everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This all started in the car ride to Tennessee playing a million questions with Shannon, Kate, and Sebs. Through the multitude of questions we discussed our life goals, best/worst traits, favorite movies, favorite drinks, and so much more. One of my favorite topics was the discussion of what animals we could possibly see in Tennessee. We all said the usual bears, snakes, and deer. Then Sebs says Elk. In response Kate and I start roasting him because in what world are there Elk in Tennessee. Well, a little googling later and it turns out Elk most definitely live in Tennessee. Who knew?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing which developed from the car ride was the many ways we thought we could use our new found free time while quarantined. We developed intellectual hour, which gained mixed reviews when we told everyone else. During this time we would read, draw, or do anything which would improve our intellect. Stas did a crossword, Nate wrote his comic, a few of us had books, and others drew or colored. We also had a puzzle which was completed twice. Once by just Julia and I, in an impressive feat driven by coffee and pure determination. The other time was by everyone else. It was pretty average I guess. Another activity during intellectual hour was Justin playing Cooking Mama on the Wii in order to expand his knowledge of recipes and culinary skills. In the end intellectual hour was a great time and I highly suggest it to everyone. It is a great way to pass the time in quarantine. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can skip this next paragraph if you have no interest in the potatoes which were described as “the best potatoes ever.” Not sure who said that or whether someone actually did, but we were all thinking it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great way to pass the time is food. By popular request I will now lay down the recipe for the potatoes I made, even though I winged it and did not follow a recipe (flex). Start by cubing, slicing, or cutting the potatoes in any shape your heart desires, just make sure the pieces are similar in size so they cook evenly. Then submerge the potatoes in water for 15 minutes, this helps remove the starch flavor and texture making them crispy. You can keep them submerged for any amount of time, even up to 3 hours! Next chop an onion and garlic. Anytype will do, but I specifically used a red onion. In a large oven safe dish mix the potatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and any seasoning. I used a Montreal Steak seasoning, but basic salt and pepper would do just fine. Deep down I wanted to use Old Bay but I forgot to bring some. In an oven preheated to 400 place the dish mixing every 10 minutes or so again to ensure even cooking. When you can easily poke the pieces of potato with a fork then they are done. This next part is optional. Now take the potatoes out of the oven and put them in a skillet on medium high heat only for a minute or so. This will give them some color and you can season to taste at this point. These potatoes will go well with chicken, streak, fish, or just by themselves. To add some more flavor you can also chop up some bacon and add that to the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To work off the great food we ate, some exercise was in store. Multiple runs and hikes were the obvious highlights of the trip. All of the runs I endeavored were no longer than 3 miles, but these were some challenging runs. Now these measly runs do not compare to the achievements of Dan Singer and Eric Baranoski. Each posted a serious run with some serious elevation gain. Eric posted a 5.5 mile run with an elevation gain of 1,076 feet, gaining two segment records on Strava. Now Dan had us worried about this run. He left with little water or food and at some point we thought we might have to go look for him, but Dan prevailed. When he came home he looked slightly dazed, but he made it. Achieving a 14 mile run with an elevation gain of 3,675 feet. The next day Dan expressed how he felt about the run when he told me, “My body is rejecting life.” A shoutout is also deserved by Stas for having an absolute blast sending it down the mountain. After Julia, Kate, and I all missed a turn we stayed to make sure no one else fell victim. Just as we were about to head back to the house I spotted the top of Stas’ head just absolutely hauling. It turns out he did not need us because he knew exactly where he was. However, if we had not stayed I would not have witnessed the gigantic smile on his face. When we returned to the house Julia, Kate and I learned that we were not alone in missing the turn. Ladies and Gents, we almost lost Sebs, but thanks to the heroics of Shannon we did not. I highly suggest checking Sebs’ Strava post from March 17. It is very entertaining. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it is time for the ultimate event of the trip, the climbing of Mount Le Conte. As someone who has very little to no experience in hiking this was amazing. Complete with waterfalls, rocks, trees, and so much more. In all seriousness I have never seen so many trees. It was a long way up, but once we got there it was so worth it. It was without a doubt the most beautiful view I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen any photos on Strava you should ask someone who was on the trip to look at them because they are breathtaking. Even though the ascent was amazing, the descent was even more incredible. In late 2016 parts of the Great Smoky Mountains were struck by wildfires. On the descent we walked through parts which had been completely destroyed. It looked like a bone yard of dead trees and branches which stretched on for miles. It was hard to believe the green and luscious forest we had walked through just a few hours ago could be reduced to this. While it was very sad to see, it was by far one of my favorite parts of the hike. It was like being on a different plant. Another amazing part of it was seeing the natural process of regrowing in the area. I received an explanation on this from nature’s very own Dan Singer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now do not worry because this was not all we did. These were just some of my personal highlights. I could have gone on and on about stuff that happened, but it would have been a lot. One thing that was missing from the trip was that we did not see a bear. Maybe for a good reason, but I still really wanted to see one.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>“Snap back to reality” - Eminem, 20th Century Philosopher</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> As I reflected on the trip with Sebs and Kate in the car ride back to College Park the reality of the current world set in. This reality was exacerbated when everyone pulled up to the Lodge Cast Iron Factory Store and it was closed. We had been looking forward to it since we arrived in Pigeon Forge, but our dreams were dashed. We talked about what it will be like with most places closed, things we were gonna miss during the semester, how club running will be affected, and other changes to our lives. During these conversations I came up with the idea to write something about my thoughts (yikes that’s a scary place) on the situation and try to find something good out of it. You got a little preview in that one weird paragraph from 3 in morning. To do this I tried to relate this to some people’s favorite part of the trip. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>The Grass Is Greener on the Other Side</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The 2016 wildfire in the Great Smoky Mountains was the worst wildfire on the East Coast since 1947. Nearly 18,000 acres of forest, trails, homes, and other buildings were destroyed in this one fire alone. This fire, the Chimney Tops 2 Fire, was the worst of many wildfires in the southeastern U.S. in 2016. Extreme drought and high winds along with loss of power to most of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge made it almost impossible for firefighters to work. Within a day of the fire starting it had reached downtown Gatlinburg. Fire swept rapidly through the area destroying everything in its path. People lost their lives, homes, and the beautiful area they lived in. Once they finally contained the fire people in Gatlinburg feared that the area was lost forever. They thought people would not want to visit the region due to the loss of beauty and the new stigma of being dangerous. This was not the case. Just as people started coming back the forest also started growing back. Now life was not the same. The scars from the fires can still be seen and have only just begun to heal. As we saw on our hike small plants and shrubs were spreading under and around the fallen branches of the destroyed forest.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as the forest and the Gatlinburg area got through what seemed the worst possible event, we will get through this. Now the forest is still regrowing and it will take some time for it to return to its former self. This will not be an easy next few weeks or God forbid months, but we will get through this together. Everyday we have to remind ourselves that it will get better. Life will be different and we will have lost things along the way, but we will have made it. It will be hard and it will hurt for a long time. However, we do not have to go through it alone. As I have learned this club is always here for you. We cannot let this situation get the better of us. We must stick together, get through this, and regrow once it is over.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'What Club Running means to me, Tennessee Trip Recap, and Some Motivation', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-club-running-means-to-me-tennessee-trip-recap-and-some-motivation', '', '', '2020-03-27 20:10:22', '2020-03-28 00:10:22', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=434', 0, 'post', '', 0),

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and the most of summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the downfall I was able to avenge myself from the year before.

Within a day of the fire starting it had reached downtown Gatlinburg. Fire swept rapidly through the area destroying everything in its path. People lost their lives, homes, and the beautiful area they lived in. Once they finally contained the fire people in Gatlinburg feared that the area was lost forever. They thought people would not want to visit the region due to the loss of beauty and the new stigma of being dangerous. This was not the case. Just as people started coming back the forest also started growing back. Now life was not the same. The scars from the fires can still be seen and have only just begun to heal.

As I have learned this club is always here for you. We cannot let this situation get the better of us.

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and the most of summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the downfall I was able to avenge myself from the year before. I signed up for the same open race where my former high school team was to compete later. This year my former coach was hurt, unable to participate, and my friend could not make it back from college. To make up for it all three of my siblings were in town, so I was feeling the pressure to perform. It was the first time my older brother had seen me race and my younger brother, who had just started high school cross country, was due to race later. Thanks to the confidence and love for running I had gained in my short time with the club I was able to have a very successful race. I came in fourth, it should have been third but the guy in front of me cut the course, with a new modest PR of 17:20 on the same course which I had failed miserably last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, weird change in writing but here it goes. I wrote the next paragraph at 3 in the morning and I was in a pretty deep place. But I liked it, so I kept it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It felt good to be back to where I was in high school, but thanks to the club that doesn’t have to be the end. The motivation I feel from the club to push myself everyday to be the best person I can be is extraordinary. This drive is not limited to running. I feel it in academics, social life, and in just being a nice person. When I joined Maryland club running this was the type of environment I hoped to find. We motivate, help, joke, and have fun with each other. While right now it seems the hole we are in is being filled with sand and there is no way out. One thing we still have is each other. We must continue to motivate each other to be the best we can be. When this is all over life will not be the same. Opportunities, major life events, and memories destined to happen will not be there, but there is one thing that will have changed for the better. You. You will have kept your head high and continued to work on bettering yourself, because when times get tough that\'s when you really grow as a person. So, yes everything sucks it sucks so much, but we can take this as an opportunity to grow because we still have one another to support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While my time with the club has been short it has grown into one of the most meaningful things in my life. I look forward to going to practice everyday and I have found a genuine love for running, more so than I ever thought I did. I appreciate all the people have made and continue to make the club what it is today.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10 / Tennessee</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will open the recap of the Tennessee trip by thanking everyone for the great time, especially those who helped organize it. As someone who basically had no hiking experience this was an amazing trip. On top of all the music, food, running, hiking, and coffee my favorite part was getting to know everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This all started in the car ride to Tennessee playing a million questions with Shannon, Kate, and Sebs. Through the multitude of questions we discussed our life goals, best/worst traits, favorite movies, favorite drinks, and so much more. One of my favorite topics was the discussion of what animals we could possibly see in Tennessee. We all said the usual bears, snakes, and deer. Then Sebs says Elk. In response Kate and I start roasting him because in what world are there Elk in Tennessee. Well, a little googling later and it turns out Elk most definitely live in Tennessee. Who knew?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing which developed from the car ride was the many ways we thought we could use our new found free time while quarantined. We developed intellectual hour, which gained mixed reviews when we told everyone else. During this time we would read, draw, or do anything which would improve our intellect. Stas did a crossword, Nate wrote his novel, a few of us had books, and others drew or colored. We also had a puzzle which was completed twice. Once by just Julia and I, in an impressive feat driven by coffee and pure determination. The other time was by everyone else, it was pretty average I guess. Another activity during intellectual hour was Justin playing Cooking Mama on the Wii in order to expand his knowledge of recipes and culinary skills. In the end intellectual hour was a great time and I highly suggest it to everyone. It is a great way to pass the time in quarantine.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can skip this next paragraph if you have no interest in the potatoes which were described as “the best potatoes ever.” Not sure who said that or whether someone actually did, but we were all thinking it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great way to pass the time is food. By popular request I will now lay down the recipe for the potatoes I made, even though I winged it and did not follow a recipe (flex). Start by cubing, slicing, or cutting the potatoes in any shape your heart desires, just make sure the pieces are similar in size so they cook evenly. Then submerge the potatoes in water for 15 minutes, this helps remove the starch flavor and texture making them crispy. You can keep them submerged for any amount of time, even up to 3 hours! Next chop an onion and garlic. Anytype will do, but I specifically used a red onion. In a large oven safe dish mix the potatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and any seasoning. I used a Montreal Steak seasoning, but basic salt and pepper would do just fine. Deep down I wanted to use Old Bay but I forgot to bring some. In an oven preheated to 400 place the dish mixing every 10 minutes or so again to ensure even cooking. When you can easily poke the pieces of potato with a fork then they are done. This next part is optional. Now take the potatoes out of the oven and put them in a skillet on medium high heat only for a minute or so. This will give them some color and you can season to taste at this point. These potatoes will go well with chicken, streak, fish, or just by themselves. To add some more flavor you can also chop up some bacon and add that to the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To work off the great food we ate, some exercise was in store. Multiple runs and hikes were the obvious highlights of the trip. All of the runs I endeavored were no longer than 3 miles, but these were some challenging runs. Now these measly runs do not compare to the achievements of Dan Singer and Eric Baranoski. Each posted a serious run with some serious elevation gain. Eric posted a 5.5 mile run with an elevation gain of 1,076 feet, gaining two segment records on strava. Now Dan had us worried about this run. He left with little water or food and at some point we thought we might have to go look for him, but Dan prevailed. When he came home he looked slightly dazed, but he made it. Achieving a 14 mile run with an elevation gain of 3,675 feet. The next day Dan expressed how he felt about the run when he told me, “My body is rejecting life.” A shoutout is also deserved by Stas for having an absolute blast sending it down the mountain. After Julia, Kate, and I all missed a turn we stayed to make sure no one else fell victim. Just as we were about to head back to the house I spotted the top of Stas’ head just absolutely hauling. It turns out he did not need us because he knew exactly where he was. However, if we had not stayed I would not have witnessed the gigantic smile on his face. When we returned to the house Julia, Kate and I learned that we were not alone in missing the turn. Ladies and Gents, we almost lost Sebs, but thanks to the heroics of Shannon we did not. I highly suggest checking Sebs’ post from March 17. It is very entertaining.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it is time for the ultimate event of the trip, the climbing of Mount Le Conte. As someone who has very little to no experience in hiking this was amazing. Complete with waterfalls, rocks, trees, and so much more. In all seriousness I have never seen so many trees. It was a long way up, but once we got there it was so worth it. It was without a doubt the most beautiful view I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen any photos on Strava you should ask someone who was on the trip to look at them because they are breathtaking. Even though the ascent was amazing, the descent was even more incredible. In late 2016 parts of the Great Smoky Mountains were struck by wildfires. On the descent we walked through parts which had been completely destroyed. It looked like a bone yard of dead trees and branches which stretched on for miles. It was hard to believe the green and luscious forest we had walked through just a few hours ago could be reduced to this. While it was very sad to see, it was by far one of my favorite parts of the hike. It was like being on a different plant. Another amazing part of it was seeing the natural process of regrowing in the area. I received an explanation on this from nature’s very own Dan Singer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now do not worry because this was not all we did. These were just some of my personal highlights. I could have gone on and on about stuff that happened, but it would have been a lot. One thing that was missing from the trip was that we did not see a bear. Maybe for a good reason, but I still really wanted to see one.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>“Snap back to reality” - Eminem, 20th Century Philosopher</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> As I reflected on the trip with Sebs and Kate in the car ride back to College Park the reality of the current world set in.

We talked about what it will be like with most places closed, things we were gonna miss during the semester, how club running will be affected, and other changes to our lives..

People lost their lives, homes, and the beautiful area they lived in. Once they finally contained the fire people in Gatlinburg feared that the area was lost forever. They thought people would not want to visit the region due to the loss of beauty and the new stigma of being dangerous. This was not the case. Just as people started coming back the forest also started growing back. Now life was not the same. The scars from the fires can still be seen and have only just begun to heal. As we saw on our hike small plants and shrubs were spreading under and around the fallen branches of the destroyed forest.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as the forest and the Gatlinburg area got through what seemed the worst possible event, we will get through this. Now the forest is still regrowing and it will take some time for it to return to its former self. This will not be an easy next few weeks or God forbid months, but we will get through this together. Everyday we have to remind ourselves that it will get better. Life will be different and we will have lost things along the way, but we will have made it. It will be hard and it will hurt for a long time. However, we do not have to go through it alone. As I have learned this club is always here for you. We cannot let this situation get the better of us.

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and most of the summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the downfall I was able to avenge myself from the year before. I signed up for the same open race where my former high school team was to compete later. This year my former coach was hurt, unable to participate, and my friend could not make it back from college. To make up for it all three of my siblings were in town, so I was feeling the pressure to perform. It was the first time my older brother had seen me race and my younger brother, who had just started high school cross country, was due to race later. Thanks to the confidence and love for running I had gained in my short time with the club I was able to have a very successful race. I came in fourth, it should have been third but the guy in front of me cut the course, with a new modest PR of 17:20 on the same course which I had failed miserably last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, weird change in writing but here it goes. I wrote the next paragraph at 3 in the morning and I was in a pretty deep place. But I liked it, so I kept it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It felt good to be back to where I was in high school, but thanks to the club that doesn’t have to be the end. The motivation I feel from the club to push myself everyday to be the best person I can be is extraordinary. This drive is not limited to running. I feel it in academics, social life, and in just being a nice person. When I joined Maryland club running this was the type of environment I hoped to find. We motivate, help, joke, and have fun with each other. While right now it seems the hole we are in is being filled with sand and there is no way out. One thing we still have is each other. We must continue to motivate each other to be the best we can be. When this is all over life will not be the same. Opportunities, major life events, and memories destined to happen will not be there, but there is one thing that will have changed for the better. You. You will have kept your head high and continued to work on bettering yourself, because when times get tough that\'s when you really grow as a person. So, yes everything sucks it sucks so much, but we can take this as an opportunity to grow because we still have one another to support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While my time with the club has been short it has grown into one of the most meaningful things in my life. I look forward to going to practice everyday and I have found a genuine love for running, more so than I ever thought I did. I appreciate all the people have made and continue to make the club what it is today.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10 / Tennessee</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will open the recap of the Tennessee trip by thanking everyone for the great time, especially those who helped organize it. As someone who basically had no hiking experience this was an amazing trip. On top of all the music, food, running, hiking, and coffee my favorite part was getting to know everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This all started in the car ride to Tennessee playing a million questions with Shannon, Kate, and Sebs. Through the multitude of questions we discussed our life goals, best/worst traits, favorite movies, favorite drinks, and so much more. One of my favorite topics was the discussion of what animals we could possibly see in Tennessee. We all said the usual bears, snakes, and deer. Then Sebs says Elk. In response Kate and I start roasting him because in what world are there Elk in Tennessee. Well, a little googling later and it turns out Elk most definitely live in Tennessee. Who knew?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing which developed from the car ride was the many ways we thought we could use our new found free time while quarantined. We developed intellectual hour, which gained mixed reviews when we told everyone else. During this time we would read, draw, or do anything which would improve our intellect. Stas did a crossword, Nate wrote his novel, a few of us had books, and others drew or colored. We also had a puzzle which was completed twice. Once by just Julia and I, in an impressive feat driven by coffee and pure determination. The other time was by everyone else, it was pretty average I guess. Another activity during intellectual hour was Justin playing Cooking Mama on the Wii in order to expand his knowledge of recipes and culinary skills. In the end intellectual hour was a great time and I highly suggest it to everyone. It is a great way to pass the time in quarantine.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can skip this next paragraph if you have no interest in the potatoes which were described as “the best potatoes ever.” Not sure who said that or whether someone actually did, but we were all thinking it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great way to pass the time is food. By popular request I will now lay down the recipe for the potatoes I made, even though I winged it and did not follow a recipe (flex). Start by cubing, slicing, or cutting the potatoes in any shape your heart desires, just make sure the pieces are similar in size so they cook evenly. Then submerge the potatoes in water for 15 minutes, this helps remove the starch flavor and texture making them crispy. You can keep them submerged for any amount of time, even up to 3 hours! Next chop an onion and garlic. Anytype will do, but I specifically used a red onion. In a large oven safe dish mix the potatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and any seasoning. I used a Montreal Steak seasoning, but basic salt and pepper would do just fine. Deep down I wanted to use Old Bay but I forgot to bring some. In an oven preheated to 400 place the dish mixing every 10 minutes or so again to ensure even cooking. When you can easily poke the pieces of potato with a fork then they are done. This next part is optional. Now take the potatoes out of the oven and put them in a skillet on medium high heat only for a minute or so. This will give them some color and you can season to taste at this point. These potatoes will go well with chicken, streak, fish, or just by themselves. To add some more flavor you can also chop up some bacon and add that to the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To work off the great food we ate, some exercise was in store. Multiple runs and hikes were the obvious highlights of the trip. All of the runs I endeavored were no longer than 3 miles, but these were some challenging runs. Now these measly runs do not compare to the achievements of Dan Singer and Eric Baranoski. Each posted a serious run with some serious elevation gain. Eric posted a 5.5 mile run with an elevation gain of 1,076 feet, gaining two segment records on strava. Now Dan had us worried about this run. He left with little water or food and at some point we thought we might have to go look for him, but Dan prevailed. When he came home he looked slightly dazed, but he made it. Achieving a 14 mile run with an elevation gain of 3,675 feet. The next day Dan expressed how he felt about the run when he told me, “My body is rejecting life.” A shoutout is also deserved by Stas for having an absolute blast sending it down the mountain. After Julia, Kate, and I all missed a turn we stayed to make sure no one else fell victim. Just as we were about to head back to the house I spotted the top of Stas’ head just absolutely hauling. It turns out he did not need us because he knew exactly where he was. However, if we had not stayed I would not have witnessed the gigantic smile on his face. When we returned to the house Julia, Kate and I learned that we were not alone in missing the turn. Ladies and Gents, we almost lost Sebs, but thanks to the heroics of Shannon we did not. I highly suggest checking Sebs’ post from March 17. It is very entertaining.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it is time for the ultimate event of the trip, the climbing of Mount Le Conte. As someone who has very little to no experience in hiking this was amazing. Complete with waterfalls, rocks, trees, and so much more. In all seriousness I have never seen so many trees. It was a long way up, but once we got there it was so worth it. It was without a doubt the most beautiful view I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen any photos on Strava you should ask someone who was on the trip to look at them because they are breathtaking. Even though the ascent was amazing, the descent was even more incredible. In late 2016 parts of the Great Smoky Mountains were struck by wildfires. On the descent we walked through parts which had been completely destroyed. It looked like a bone yard of dead trees and branches which stretched on for miles. It was hard to believe the green and luscious forest we had walked through just a few hours ago could be reduced to this. While it was very sad to see, it was by far one of my favorite parts of the hike. It was like being on a different plant. Another amazing part of it was seeing the natural process of regrowing in the area. I received an explanation on this from nature’s very own Dan Singer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now do not worry because this was not all we did. These were just some of my personal highlights. I could have gone on and on about stuff that happened, but it would have been a lot.

Maybe for a good reason, but I still really wanted to see one.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>“Snap back to reality” - Eminem, 20th Century Philosopher</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> As I reflected on the trip with Sebs and Kate in the car ride back to College Park the reality of the current world set in.

We talked about what it will be like with most places closed, things we were gonna miss during the semester, how club running will be affected, and other changes to our lives.

This fire, the Chimney Tops 2 Fire, was the worst of many wildfires in the southeastern U.S. in 2016. Extreme drought and high winds along with loss of power to most of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge made it almost impossible for firefighters to work. Within a day of the fire starting it had reached downtown Gatlinburg. Fire swept rapidly through the area destroying everything in its path. People lost their lives, homes, and the beautiful area they lived in. Once they finally contained the fire people in Gatlinburg feared that the area was lost forever. They thought people would not want to visit the region due to the loss of beauty and the new stigma of being dangerous. This was not the case. Just as people started coming back the forest also started growing back. Now life was not the same. The scars from the fires can still be seen and have only just begun to heal.

Everyday we have to remind ourselves that it will get better. Life will be different and we will have lost things along the way, but we will have made it.

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and most of the summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the injury I was able to avenge myself from the year before. I signed up for the same open race where my former high school team was to compete later. This year my former coach was hurt, unable to participate, and my friend could not make it back from college. To make up for it all three of my siblings were in town, so I was feeling the pressure to perform. It was the first time my older brother had seen me race and my younger brother, who had just started high school cross country, was due to race later. Thanks to the confidence and love for running I had gained in my short time with the club, I was able to have a very successful race. I came in fourth, it should have been third but the guy in front of me cut the course, with a new modest PR of 17:20 on the same course which I had failed miserably last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, weird change in writing but here it goes. I wrote the next paragraph at 3 in the morning and I was in a pretty deep place. But I liked it, so I kept it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It felt good to be back to where I was in high school, but thanks to the club that doesn’t have to be the end. The motivation I feel from the club to push myself everyday to be the best person I can be is extraordinary. This drive is not limited to running. I feel it in academics, social life, and in just being a nice person. When I joined Maryland club running this was the type of environment I hoped to find. We motivate, help, joke, and have fun with each other. While right now it seems the hole we are in is being filled with sand and there is no way out. One thing we still have is each other. We must continue to motivate each other to be the best we can be. When this is all over life will not be the same. Opportunities, major life events, and memories destined to happen will not be there, but there is one thing that will have changed for the better. You. You will have kept your head high and continued to work on bettering yourself, because when times get tough that\'s when you really grow as a person. So, yes everything sucks it sucks so much, but we can take this as an opportunity to grow because we still have one another to support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While my time with the club has been short it has grown into one of the most meaningful things in my life. I look forward to going to practice everyday and I have found a genuine love for running, more so than I ever thought I did. I appreciate all the people have made and continue to make the club what it is today.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10 / Tennessee</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will open the recap of the Tennessee trip by thanking everyone for the great time, especially those who helped organize it. As someone who basically had no hiking experience this was an amazing trip. On top of all the music, food, running, hiking, and coffee my favorite part was getting to know everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This all started in the car ride to Tennessee playing a million questions with Shannon, Kate, and Sebs. Through the multitude of questions we discussed our life goals, best/worst traits, favorite movies, favorite drinks, and so much more. One of my favorite topics was the discussion of what animals we could possibly see in Tennessee. We all said the usual bears, snakes, and deer. Then Sebs says Elk. In response Kate and I start roasting him because in what world are there Elk in Tennessee. Well, a little googling later and it turns out Elk most definitely live in Tennessee. Who knew?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing which developed from the car ride was the many ways we thought we could use our new found free time while quarantined. We developed intellectual hour, which gained mixed reviews when we told everyone else. During this time we would read, draw, or do anything which would improve our intellect. Stas did a crossword, Nate wrote his novel, a few of us had books, and others drew or colored. We also had a puzzle which was completed twice. Once by just Julia and I, in an impressive feat driven by coffee and pure determination. The other time was by everyone else, it was pretty average I guess. Another activity during intellectual hour was Justin playing Cooking Mama on the Wii in order to expand his knowledge of recipes and culinary skills. In the end intellectual hour was a great time and I highly suggest it to everyone. It is a great way to pass the time in quarantine.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can skip this next paragraph if you have no interest in the potatoes which were described as “the best potatoes ever.” Not sure who said that or whether someone actually did, but we were all thinking it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great way to pass the time is food. By popular request I will now lay down the recipe for the potatoes I made, even though I winged it and did not follow a recipe (flex). Start by cubing, slicing, or cutting the potatoes in any shape your heart desires, just make sure the pieces are similar in size so they cook evenly. Then submerge the potatoes in water for 15 minutes, this helps remove the starch flavor and texture making them crispy. You can keep them submerged for any amount of time, even up to 3 hours! Next chop an onion and garlic. Anytype will do, but I specifically used a red onion. In a large oven safe dish mix the potatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and any seasoning. I used a Montreal Steak seasoning, but basic salt and pepper would do just fine. Deep down I wanted to use Old Bay but I forgot to bring some. In an oven preheated to 400 place the dish mixing every 10 minutes or so again to ensure even cooking. When you can easily poke the pieces of potato with a fork then they are done. This next part is optional. Now take the potatoes out of the oven and put them in a skillet on medium high heat only for a minute or so. This will give them some color and you can season to taste at this point. These potatoes will go well with chicken, streak, fish, or just by themselves. To add some more flavor you can also chop up some bacon and add that to the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To work off the great food we ate, some exercise was in store. Multiple runs and hikes were the obvious highlights of the trip. All of the runs I endeavored were no longer than 3 miles, but these were some challenging runs. Now these measly runs do not compare to the achievements of Dan Singer and Eric Baranoski. Each posted a serious run with some serious elevation gain. Eric posted a 5.5 mile run with an elevation gain of 1,076 feet, gaining two segment records on strava. Now Dan had us worried about this run. He left with little water or food and at some point we thought we might have to go look for him, but Dan prevailed. When he came home he looked slightly dazed, but he made it. Achieving a 14 mile run with an elevation gain of 3,675 feet. The next day Dan expressed how he felt about the run when he told me, “My body is rejecting life.” A shoutout is also deserved by Stas for having an absolute blast sending it down the mountain. After Julia, Kate, and I all missed a turn we stayed to make sure no one else fell victim. Just as we were about to head back to the house I spotted the top of Stas’ head just absolutely hauling. It turns out he did not need us because he knew exactly where he was. However, if we had not stayed I would not have witnessed the gigantic smile on his face. When we returned to the house Julia, Kate and I learned that we were not alone in missing the turn. Ladies and Gents, we almost lost Sebs, but thanks to the heroics of Shannon we did not. I highly suggest checking Sebs’ post from March 17. It is very entertaining.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it is time for the ultimate event of the trip, the climbing of Mount Le Conte. As someone who has very little to no experience in hiking this was amazing. Complete with waterfalls, rocks, trees, and so much more. In all seriousness I have never seen so many trees. It was a long way up, but once we got there it was so worth it. It was without a doubt the most beautiful view I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen any photos on Strava you should ask someone who was on the trip to look at them because they are breathtaking. Even though the ascent was amazing, the descent was even more incredible. In late 2016 parts of the Great Smoky Mountains were struck by wildfires. On the descent we walked through parts which had been completely destroyed. It looked like a bone yard of dead trees and branches which stretched on for miles. It was hard to believe the green and luscious forest we had walked through just a few hours ago could be reduced to this. While it was very sad to see, it was by far one of my favorite parts of the hike. It was like being on a different plant. Another amazing part of it was seeing the natural process of regrowing in the area. I received an explanation on this from nature’s very own Dan Singer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now do not worry because this was not all we did. These were just some of my personal highlights. I could have gone on and on about stuff that happened, but it would have been a lot. One thing that was missing from the trip was that we did not see a bear. Maybe for a good reason, but I still really wanted to see one.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>“Snap back to reality” - Eminem, 20th Century Philosopher</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> As I reflected on the trip with Sebs and Kate in the car ride back to College Park the reality of the current world set in.

We talked about what it will be like with most places closed, things we were gonna miss during the semester, how club running will be affected, and other changes to our lives.

Nearly 18,000 acres of forest, trails, homes, and other buildings were destroyed in this one fire alone. This fire, the Chimney Tops 2 Fire, was the worst of many wildfires in the southeastern U.S. in 2016. Extreme drought and high winds along with loss of power to most of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge made it almost impossible for firefighters to work. Within a day of the fire starting it had reached downtown Gatlinburg. Fire swept rapidly through the area destroying everything in its path. People lost their lives, homes, and the beautiful area they lived in. Once they finally contained the fire people in Gatlinburg feared that the area was lost forever. They thought people would not want to visit the region due to the loss of beauty and the new stigma of being dangerous. This was not the case. Just as people started coming back the forest also started growing back. Now life was not the same. The scars from the fires can still be seen and have only just begun to heal. As we saw on our hike small plants and shrubs were spreading under and around the fallen branches of the destroyed forest.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as the forest and the Gatlinburg area got through what seemed the worst possible event, we will get through this. Now the forest is still regrowing and it will take some time for it to return to its former self. This will not be an easy next few weeks or God forbid months, but we will get through this together. Everyday we have to remind ourselves that it will get better. Life will be different and we will have lost things along the way, but we will have made it. It will be hard and it will hurt for a long time. However, we do not have to go through it alone. As I have learned this club is always here for you. We cannot let this situation get the better of us. We must stick together, get through this, and regrow once it is over.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'What Club Running means to me, Tennessee Trip Recap, and Some Motivation', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '434-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-03-27 19:55:37', '2020-03-27 23:55:37', '', 434, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/434-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and most of the summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the injury I was able to avenge myself from the year before. I signed up for the same open race where my former high school team was to compete later. This year my former coach was hurt, unable to participate, and my friend could not make it back from college. To make up for it all three of my siblings were in town, so I was feeling the pressure to perform. It was the first time my older brother had seen me race and my younger brother, who had just started high school cross country, was due to race later. Thanks to the confidence and love for running I had gained in my short time with the club, I was able to have a very successful race. I came in fourth, it should have been third but the guy in front of me cut the course, with a new modest PR of 17:20 on the same course which I had failed miserably last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, weird change in writing but here it goes. I wrote the next paragraph at 3 in the morning and I was in a pretty deep place. But I liked it, so I kept it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It felt good to be back to where I was in high school, but thanks to the club that doesn’t have to be the end. The motivation I feel from the club to push myself everyday to be the best person I can be is extraordinary. This drive is not limited to running. I feel it in academics, social life, and in just being a nice person. When I joined Maryland club running this was the type of environment I hoped to find. We motivate, help, joke, and have fun with each other. While right now it seems the hole we are in is being filled with sand and there is no way out. One thing we still have is each other. We must continue to motivate each other to be the best we can be. When this is all over life will not be the same. Opportunities, major life events, and memories destined to happen will not be there, but there is one thing that will have changed for the better. You. You will have kept your head high and continued to work on bettering yourself, because when times get tough that\'s when you really grow as a person. So, yes everything sucks it sucks so much, but we can take this as an opportunity to grow because we still have one another to support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While my time with the club has been short it has grown into one of the most meaningful things in my life. I look forward to going to practice everyday and I have found a genuine love for running, more so than I ever thought I did. I appreciate all the people who have made and continue to make the club what it is today.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10 / Tennessee</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will open the recap of the Tennessee trip by thanking everyone for the great time, especially those who helped organize it. As someone who basically had no hiking experience this was an amazing trip. On top of all the music, food, running, hiking, and coffee my favorite part was getting to know everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This all started in the car ride to Tennessee playing a million questions with Shannon, Kate, and Sebs. Through the multitude of questions we discussed our life goals, best/worst traits, favorite movies, favorite drinks, and so much more. One of my favorite topics was the discussion of what animals we could possibly see in Tennessee. We all said the usual bears, snakes, and deer. Then Sebs says Elk. In response Kate and I start roasting him because in what world are there Elk in Tennessee. Well, a little googling later and it turns out Elk most definitely live in Tennessee. Who knew?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing which developed from the car ride was the many ways we thought we could use our new found free time while quarantined. We developed intellectual hour, which gained mixed reviews when we told everyone else. During this time we would read, draw, or do anything which would improve our intellect. Stas did a crossword, Nate wrote his comic, a few of us had books, and others drew or colored. We also had a puzzle which was completed twice. Once by just Julia and I, in an impressive feat driven by coffee and pure determination. The other time was by everyone else, it was pretty average I guess. Another activity during intellectual hour was Justin playing Cooking Mama on the Wii in order to expand his knowledge of recipes and culinary skills. In the end intellectual hour was a great time and I highly suggest it to everyone. It is a great way to pass the time in quarantine. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can skip this next paragraph if you have no interest in the potatoes which were described as “the best potatoes ever.” Not sure who said that or whether someone actually did, but we were all thinking it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great way to pass the time is food. By popular request I will now lay down the recipe for the potatoes I made, even though I winged it and did not follow a recipe (flex). Start by cubing, slicing, or cutting the potatoes in any shape your heart desires, just make sure the pieces are similar in size so they cook evenly. Then submerge the potatoes in water for 15 minutes, this helps remove the starch flavor and texture making them crispy. You can keep them submerged for any amount of time, even up to 3 hours! Next chop an onion and garlic. Anytype will do, but I specifically used a red onion. In a large oven safe dish mix the potatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and any seasoning. I used a Montreal Steak seasoning, but basic salt and pepper would do just fine. Deep down I wanted to use Old Bay but I forgot to bring some. In an oven preheated to 400 place the dish mixing every 10 minutes or so again to ensure even cooking. When you can easily poke the pieces of potato with a fork then they are done. This next part is optional. Now take the potatoes out of the oven and put them in a skillet on medium high heat only for a minute or so. This will give them some color and you can season to taste at this point. These potatoes will go well with chicken, streak, fish, or just by themselves. To add some more flavor you can also chop up some bacon and add that to the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To work off the great food we ate, some exercise was in store. Multiple runs and hikes were the obvious highlights of the trip. All of the runs I endeavored were no longer than 3 miles, but these were some challenging runs. Now these measly runs do not compare to the achievements of Dan Singer and Eric Baranoski. Each posted a serious run with some serious elevation gain. Eric posted a 5.5 mile run with an elevation gain of 1,076 feet, gaining two segment records on strava. Now Dan had us worried about this run. He left with little water or food and at some point we thought we might have to go look for him, but Dan prevailed. When he came home he looked slightly dazed, but he made it. Achieving a 14 mile run with an elevation gain of 3,675 feet. The next day Dan expressed how he felt about the run when he told me, “My body is rejecting life.” A shoutout is also deserved by Stas for having an absolute blast sending it down the mountain. After Julia, Kate, and I all missed a turn we stayed to make sure no one else fell victim. Just as we were about to head back to the house I spotted the top of Stas’ head just absolutely hauling. It turns out he did not need us because he knew exactly where he was. However, if we had not stayed I would not have witnessed the gigantic smile on his face. When we returned to the house Julia, Kate and I learned that we were not alone in missing the turn. Ladies and Gents, we almost lost Sebs, but thanks to the heroics of Shannon we did not. I highly suggest checking Sebs’ post from March 17. It is very entertaining.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it is time for the ultimate event of the trip, the climbing of Mount Le Conte. As someone who has very little to no experience in hiking this was amazing. Complete with waterfalls, rocks, trees, and so much more. In all seriousness I have never seen so many trees. It was a long way up, but once we got there it was so worth it. It was without a doubt the most beautiful view I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen any photos on Strava you should ask someone who was on the trip to look at them because they are breathtaking. Even though the ascent was amazing, the descent was even more incredible. In late 2016 parts of the Great Smoky Mountains were struck by wildfires. On the descent we walked through parts which had been completely destroyed. It looked like a bone yard of dead trees and branches which stretched on for miles. It was hard to believe the green and luscious forest we had walked through just a few hours ago could be reduced to this. While it was very sad to see, it was by far one of my favorite parts of the hike. It was like being on a different plant. Another amazing part of it was seeing the natural process of regrowing in the area. I received an explanation on this from nature’s very own Dan Singer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now do not worry because this was not all we did. These were just some of my personal highlights. I could have gone on and on about stuff that happened, but it would have been a lot. One thing that was missing from the trip was that we did not see a bear. Maybe for a good reason, but I still really wanted to see one.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>“Snap back to reality” - Eminem, 20th Century Philosopher</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> As I reflected on the trip with Sebs and Kate in the car ride back to College Park the reality of the current world set in. This reality was exacerbated when everyone pulled up to the Lodge Cast Iron Factory Store and it was closed. We had been looking forward to it since we arrived in Pigeon Forge, but our dreams were dashed. We talked about what it will be like with most places closed, things we were gonna miss during the semester, how club running will be affected, and other changes to our lives. During these conversations I came up with the idea to write something about my thoughts (yikes that’s a scary place) on the situation and try to find something good out of it.

Nearly 18,000 acres of forest, trails, homes, and other buildings were destroyed in this one fire alone. This fire, the Chimney Tops 2 Fire, was the worst of many wildfires in the southeastern U.S. in 2016. Extreme drought and high winds along with loss of power to most of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge made it almost impossible for firefighters to work. Within a day of the fire starting it had reached downtown Gatlinburg. Fire swept rapidly through the area destroying everything in its path. People lost their lives, homes, and the beautiful area they lived in. Once they finally contained the fire people in Gatlinburg feared that the area was lost forever. They thought people would not want to visit the region due to the loss of beauty and the new stigma of being dangerous. This was not the case. Just as people started coming back the forest also started growing back. Now life was not the same. The scars from the fires can still be seen and have only just begun to heal.

After finishing a successful spring track season senior year of high school the next thing on my mind was starting a new life at the University of Maryland. While I looked into the idea of joining the club running team, I decided against it as I believed I was finished with running. Or so I thought. During the fall semester my freshman year I rarely ran. With some new unholy additions to my diet, that skinny long distance runner from high school was long gone. In the shell of my former self I signed up for the Glory Days 5k, an open cross country race where my former high school team was to race later that day. My former coach along with my best friend from high school joined me in the endeavor. As one can imagine, hungover and abysmally out of shape I failed to break 25 in the 5k race on the same course which I ran 17:26 just a year ago. Embarrassed, I returned to College Park with a never again attitude. Now spring semester came about and I realized that these unhealthy habits needed to be counteracted with some exercise if I was to return to glory next year. I soon started going to the gym and running again. This satisfied me for the rest of the semester and most of the summer, but when sophomore year rolled around the bug caught me. Not just the running bug, the competing bug. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> After much thought and deliberation, not really, I decided to give club running a try. I do not actually remember when or how I decided to join it kinda just happened. On the first day of practice I rolled up and the first person I talked to was a legend by the name of Ryan Mayhew. Now Ryan was also new to the party, but we were soon met by an overwhelming number of new names and faces to remember. However, they soon all became familiar faces as practice became the highlight of each and every day. Not only is practice a fun time spent with friends where silly and weird phenomena take place daily. It is also a great time to relieve stress. Practice gives you time away from your phone to talk to someone about the troubles of life in College Park. Now if I found myself lucky enough to run with Graham I would most likely talk about some random topic from the dark recesses of his subconscious. If not then I probably had a normal conversation. All the great conversations make practice and the mileage almost addicting. Despite barely having built up at all during the summer I soon found myself dropping 60 mile weeks like it was nothing. You all know where this is going. Roughly halfway into the season the mileage caught up with my legs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, before the injury I was able to avenge myself from the year before. I signed up for the same open race where my former high school team was to compete later. This year my former coach was hurt, unable to participate, and my friend could not make it back from college. To make up for it all three of my siblings were in town, so I was feeling the pressure to perform. It was the first time my older brother had seen me race and my younger brother, who had just started high school cross country, was due to race later. Thanks to the confidence and love for running I had gained in my short time with the club, I was able to have a very successful race. I came in fourth, it should have been third but the guy in front of me cut the course, with a new modest PR of 17:20 on the same course which I had failed miserably last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, weird change in writing but here it goes. I wrote the next paragraph at 3 in the morning and I was in a pretty deep place. But I liked it, so I kept it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It felt good to be back to where I was in high school, but thanks to the club that doesn’t have to be the end. The motivation I feel from the club to push myself everyday to be the best person I can be is extraordinary. This drive is not limited to running. I feel it in academics, social life, and in just being a nice person. When I joined Maryland club running this was the type of environment I hoped to find. We motivate, help, joke, and have fun with each other. While right now it seems the hole we are in is being filled with sand and there is no way out. One thing we still have is each other. We must continue to motivate each other to be the best we can be. When this is all over life will not be the same. Opportunities, major life events, and memories destined to happen will not be there, but there is one thing that will have changed for the better. You. You will have kept your head high and continued to work on bettering yourself, because when times get tough that\'s when you really grow as a person. So, yes everything sucks it sucks so much, but we can take this as an opportunity to grow because we still have one another to support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While my time with the club has been short it has grown into one of the most meaningful things in my life. I look forward to going to practice everyday and I have found a genuine love for running, more so than I ever thought I did. I appreciate all the people who have made and continue to make the club what it is today.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10 / Tennessee</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will open the recap of the Tennessee trip by thanking everyone for the great time, especially those who helped organize it. As someone who basically had no hiking experience this was an amazing trip. On top of all the music, food, running, hiking, and coffee my favorite part was getting to know everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This all started in the car ride to Tennessee playing a million questions with Shannon, Kate, and Sebs. Through the multitude of questions we discussed our life goals, best/worst traits, favorite movies, favorite drinks, and so much more. One of my favorite topics was the discussion of what animals we could possibly see in Tennessee. We all said the usual bears, snakes, and deer. Then Sebs says Elk. In response Kate and I start roasting him because in what world are there Elk in Tennessee. Well, a little googling later and it turns out Elk most definitely live in Tennessee. Who knew?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing which developed from the car ride was the many ways we thought we could use our new found free time while quarantined. We developed intellectual hour, which gained mixed reviews when we told everyone else. During this time we would read, draw, or do anything which would improve our intellect. Stas did a crossword, Nate wrote his comic, a few of us had books, and others drew or colored. We also had a puzzle which was completed twice. Once by just Julia and I, in an impressive feat driven by coffee and pure determination. The other time was by everyone else. It was pretty average I guess. Another activity during intellectual hour was Justin playing Cooking Mama on the Wii in order to expand his knowledge of recipes and culinary skills. In the end intellectual hour was a great time and I highly suggest it to everyone. It is a great way to pass the time in quarantine. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can skip this next paragraph if you have no interest in the potatoes which were described as “the best potatoes ever.” Not sure who said that or whether someone actually did, but we were all thinking it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great way to pass the time is food. By popular request I will now lay down the recipe for the potatoes I made, even though I winged it and did not follow a recipe (flex). Start by cubing, slicing, or cutting the potatoes in any shape your heart desires, just make sure the pieces are similar in size so they cook evenly. Then submerge the potatoes in water for 15 minutes, this helps remove the starch flavor and texture making them crispy. You can keep them submerged for any amount of time, even up to 3 hours! Next chop an onion and garlic. Anytype will do, but I specifically used a red onion. In a large oven safe dish mix the potatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and any seasoning. I used a Montreal Steak seasoning, but basic salt and pepper would do just fine. Deep down I wanted to use Old Bay but I forgot to bring some. In an oven preheated to 400 place the dish mixing every 10 minutes or so again to ensure even cooking. When you can easily poke the pieces of potato with a fork then they are done. This next part is optional. Now take the potatoes out of the oven and put them in a skillet on medium high heat only for a minute or so. This will give them some color and you can season to taste at this point. These potatoes will go well with chicken, streak, fish, or just by themselves. To add some more flavor you can also chop up some bacon and add that to the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To work off the great food we ate, some exercise was in store. Multiple runs and hikes were the obvious highlights of the trip. All of the runs I endeavored were no longer than 3 miles, but these were some challenging runs. Now these measly runs do not compare to the achievements of Dan Singer and Eric Baranoski. Each posted a serious run with some serious elevation gain. Eric posted a 5.5 mile run with an elevation gain of 1,076 feet, gaining two segment records on Strava. Now Dan had us worried about this run. He left with little water or food and at some point we thought we might have to go look for him, but Dan prevailed. When he came home he looked slightly dazed, but he made it. Achieving a 14 mile run with an elevation gain of 3,675 feet. The next day Dan expressed how he felt about the run when he told me, “My body is rejecting life.” A shoutout is also deserved by Stas for having an absolute blast sending it down the mountain. After Julia, Kate, and I all missed a turn we stayed to make sure no one else fell victim. Just as we were about to head back to the house I spotted the top of Stas’ head just absolutely hauling. It turns out he did not need us because he knew exactly where he was. However, if we had not stayed I would not have witnessed the gigantic smile on his face. When we returned to the house Julia, Kate and I learned that we were not alone in missing the turn. Ladies and Gents, we almost lost Sebs, but thanks to the heroics of Shannon we did not. I highly suggest checking Sebs’ Strava post from March 17. It is very entertaining. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it is time for the ultimate event of the trip, the climbing of Mount Le Conte. As someone who has very little to no experience in hiking this was amazing. Complete with waterfalls, rocks, trees, and so much more. In all seriousness I have never seen so many trees. It was a long way up, but once we got there it was so worth it. It was without a doubt the most beautiful view I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen any photos on Strava you should ask someone who was on the trip to look at them because they are breathtaking. Even though the ascent was amazing, the descent was even more incredible. In late 2016 parts of the Great Smoky Mountains were struck by wildfires. On the descent we walked through parts which had been completely destroyed. It looked like a bone yard of dead trees and branches which stretched on for miles. It was hard to believe the green and luscious forest we had walked through just a few hours ago could be reduced to this. While it was very sad to see, it was by far one of my favorite parts of the hike. It was like being on a different plant. Another amazing part of it was seeing the natural process of regrowing in the area. I received an explanation on this from nature’s very own Dan Singer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now do not worry because this was not all we did. These were just some of my personal highlights. I could have gone on and on about stuff that happened, but it would have been a lot. One thing that was missing from the trip was that we did not see a bear. Maybe for a good reason, but I still really wanted to see one.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>“Snap back to reality” - Eminem, 20th Century Philosopher</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> As I reflected on the trip with Sebs and Kate in the car ride back to College Park the reality of the current world set in. This reality was exacerbated when everyone pulled up to the Lodge Cast Iron Factory Store and it was closed.

We talked about what it will be like with most places closed, things we were gonna miss during the semester, how club running will be affected, and other changes to our lives.

As a scrawny sophomore, I still wore white knee-length compression shorts under my uniform split shorts because the sight of my own thighs crippled me with anxiety. Even as an insecure 15-year-old, nothing instilled confidence in myself more than my running. The sweet spot of my career, that first year when you start taking your training seriously and it pays off, had begun. I PR’ed in almost every race I entered as a sophomore and looked towards my first state championship unfazed by the challenge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, when my two coaches huddled my team in a science\nclassroom after practice a few days before the state meet to give us a pep\ntalk, I almost fell asleep. I didn’t need any extra motivation. Why would I?\nRunning was simple; you show up, you do your best, and your best comes out. The\nignorance borne of youth and absence of adversity made me invincible. Why were\nwe taking an extra twenty minutes to “inspire” ourselves after practice when I\ncould be studying for pre-calc or playing <em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em>? (My\ntime was precious, you see).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my coach began reading us an excerpt from some popular\nrunning book, I rolled my eyes and checked out. How could anyone possibly write\nan entire book about something so mundane, so easy, and so mind-numbingly\nsingular? Three days later, further supporting my theory that I knew everything\nand had figured out the secrets of life at 15 years old, I ran a PR at the\nstate championship and earned a top 25 medal. Running’s easy, keep your books\nto yourself!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six years, four major injuries, and countless heartbreaking\nworkouts and disappointing races later, I saw myself preparing for my last collegiate\ntrack season a tad fed up with running poorly. A novel idea arose; maybe my incredibly\nexperienced coach knew what she was talking about. Whilst shopping for\nChristmas presents, I figured I’d splurge on a little something for myself: a\ncopy of John Parker Jr.’s <em>Once a Runner, </em>the very story I discounted six\nyears prior. Many runners hail Parker’s novel as “the best book ever written\nabout running” (it says that on the cover though, so the critical thinker in me\ntook that with a fist-sized grain of salt). Maybe I had been missing some\nsecret this whole time, and somewhere in 250 pages lay some sentiment that would\nelectrify the end of my collegiate running career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>            In a week, this book melted my skepticism. I was in love. The way Parker created a fictional world of a collegiate distance runner that felt realer than anything was like nothing I had ever read before. This book <em>understood me</em>. Everything from the pre-race jitters to the unspoken politics of track teams, from the annoyance of being constantly confused with “health-nuts” to the subtle unease of skipping a training day, and most importantly, the constant drive to improve and the mysterious, unnameable source of that drive, was <em>there</em> and expressed succinctly, almost poetically. It was as if some distant, unknown cousin came for a surprise visit and started showing me grainy photographs of long-lost family members resembling me. Parker’s book was new to me and from a completely different time, but at the same time the little touches that adorned every aspect of his world felt eerily familiar, like I had seen them a thousand times over without ever bothering to put a name to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a quick account of the book hopefully low on spoilers,\nParker, a former mile champion himself, pens a fictional tale of an avatar of\nhimself: Quenton Cassidy, a talented, self-deprecating yet delightfully cocky miler\nentering his senior year in Florida’s fictional Southeastern University in the\nearly 70’s. The book takes a simultaneously irreverent and deadly serious look\ninside Cassidy’s mind as he prepares for his final year of track. Unfortunately,\nfor reasons I’ll not disclose here, Cassidy, in the shape of his life, gets banned\nfrom competition in the spring. In the midst of a challenge completely\nunrelated to running, Cassidy faces a choice: change his lifestyle completely\nin order to continue his pursuit of running perfection, or accept the hand\ndealt to him and walk away quietly to a life without competitive running. If\nyou could guess, he choses the former, isolates himself in a desolate cabin in the\nwoods, and triples his efforts in pursuit of becoming the perfect miler.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>            This book lit my soul on fire in January, and that flame warded me against laziness and the winter’s cold. The simplicity and ferocity with which I trained returned to 15-year-old me levels. Running was still the inherently simple, and sometimes painfully mundane task it was six years ago, but I could love it all the same because this book reawakened my passion for that simplicity. This was my last track season, and thanks to Parker and Cassidy, it would be explosive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>            That is, it <em>would have been</em> had the world not ceased its rotation before spring break. Alas, like many seniors around the country, the track season I thought to be my magnum opus no longer existed. While this is not meant to be some self-obsessed account of why this pandemic specifically harms <em>me,</em> an upper-middle class college student with no health problems or compromised family members, hopefully you can understand and relate to my disappointment, if only a little bit. Running’s purist beauty, after two months, became poisoned with extraneous hardships and complexity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with the similar choice as Cassidy, I wasn’t ready\nto quit in the face of adversity. I was in great shape, the product of four months\nof excellently consistent training and four years of equally consistent suffering.\nWhy stop now? My valiant quarantine training commenced! I scheduled a time\ntrial with my roommates. I held the intensity of my training afloat as best I\ncould with a growing tidal wave of apathy lurking in the background. This was\nsimply another test, right? Just as Cassidy states during a particularly difficult\nbout of overtraining, “from the crucible of such inner turmoil comes the\nvarious metals, soft or brittle, flawed or pure, that determine the good\nrunners, the great runners, and perhaps the former runners.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>              Loosely translated; if you don’t keep training just because your precious little season got cancelled, you’re a fraud. Quarantine hadn’t changed running, just everything else around it. The bleachers had been stripped of your audience, your efforts lost the promise of medals and ribbons, and your training lost the levity brought by training partners. Running is still there though, and if you don’t love it at its worst, you don’t deserve it at its best *<em>vomits*.</em> Your training should have the same, nay, double the intensity it did before or else you weren’t a true believer, just some tourist experimenting with the life of a true runner for a couple years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>            Curiously enough, I’m a fraud. Physically poised to run a 5k time-trial that I thought would be the first of a lengthy “Quarantine Racing Series,” I toed the line at the track one March afternoon feeling oddly tired, and just a bit bored. A tad over 2k in, that boredom evolved to intolerable discomfort and crushing disinterest, so I stepped of the track, sat in the sandpit, and untied my spikes. Four days later, I couldn’t imagine keeping up any form of training, and declared a hiatus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>            Confused, frustrated, and just plain <em>tired</em>, I picked <em>Once a Runner</em> off my desk to try and rekindle the spark. This book is a cult classic beloved by millions. It couldn’t be meaningless, could it? There had to be something in this fiction that was real, irrefutable, and constant: some golden truth that I needed to reconsult to give my struggle meaning again. This time, I read closer, scrutinizing themes and ideas more deeply than the first time around. I even wrote down important quotes accompanied by page numbers (<em>please clap).</em> I left not disappointed, but with a wildly different impression. Without giving too much away for any of you who haven’t read it (a condition I still think you should fix), I left the second read with three key flaws in the book I previously thought perfect. After a brief online search, it seems that these criticisms aren’t anything new. So, to summarize those flaws:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>This book glorifies overtraining.</strong> When I brought up the superhuman volume of Cassidy’s training to my roommate, he countered with “It was the 70’s man, everybody trained like that.” Upon my first read, yes, Cassidy’s constant 140-mile weeks (in preparation to race a <em>mile,</em> mind you) stood out as ridiculous. However, upon a second read, the issue runs deeper than a miler doing double the necessary mileage. When Cassidy begins suffering physically from increasing his mileage (sleeping 14 hours a day, eating poorly, feeling depressed and irritable, ignoring his girlfriend, and skipping class) he throws out some macho 9<sup>th</sup> grade one-liners about how overtraining is a necessary part of the process: Cassidy’s “Trial of Miles.” The book presents an uncompromising message towards training. The “secret” to success is running a lot, pretty fast (about 6 min/mile), twice every day, without any days off. If you can’t commit to that, you suck and you’re wasting your time. Cassidy’s idol and coach, Bruce Denton, runs twice a day through a sickness that leaves him bedridden and puking for the rest of the day. Cassidy trains similarly and never suffers an injury or underperforms in a race (his slowest mile race in the book is about 4:03). How convenient. Cassidy’s infamous interval workout (which lies in one of the best written chapters so I won’t spoil what it is), demands paces and volume that make a training montage from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> look realistic. Cassidy, Denton, and their teammate Jerry Mizner, train like insufferable morons for the entire book. Don’t read this looking for training advice.</li><li><strong>This book’s main theme has sexist undertones. </strong>When I first read this book, I saw some of the sexism in it and wrote it off. It’s set in the Deep South in the 70’s, so I expected some of it. But I’m not talking about how the school football coach is a womanizer (his name is Dick Doobey, I’d be surprised if he wasn’t), nor am I talking about how the jocks single out “ugly girls” to cheat off of during exams, or about that bizarre, glancing sentence where Cassidy kisses a random nurse on the forehead before sprinting away and we’re supposed to think he\'s some charming rogue for it. I don’t mind the first two because the football establishment and its members are villains and villains are prone to, well, villainy. The third is obnoxious, and there’s loads of minuscule, one-off sentences like it where a woman is reduced to “a sweet thing” or some other outdated one-liner that could have been omitted without any consequence to the story. The larger, possibly unforgivable offense lies in the writing of Cassidy’s girlfriend Andrea, the only female character given more than ten lines of dialogue.

Even as an insecure 15-year-old, nothing instilled confidence in myself more than my running. The sweet spot of my career, that first year when you start taking your training seriously and it pays off, had begun.

I didn’t need any extra motivation. Why would I?\nRunning was simple; you show up, you do your best, and your best comes out. The\nignorance borne of youth and absence of adversity made me invincible. Why were\nwe taking an extra twenty minutes to “inspire” ourselves after practice when I\ncould be studying for pre-calc or playing <em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em>? (My\ntime was precious, you see).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my coach began reading us an excerpt from some popular\nrunning book, I rolled my eyes and checked out. How could anyone possibly write\nan entire book about something so mundane, so easy, and so mind-numbingly\nsingular? Three days later, further supporting my theory that I knew everything\nand had figured out the secrets of life at 15 years old, I ran a PR at the\nstate championship and earned a top 25 medal. Running’s easy, keep your books\nto yourself!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six years, four major injuries, and countless heartbreaking\nworkouts and disappointing races later, I saw myself preparing for my last collegiate\ntrack season a tad fed up with running poorly. A novel idea arose; maybe my incredibly\nexperienced coach knew what she was talking about. Whilst shopping for\nChristmas presents, I figured I’d splurge on a little something for myself: a\ncopy of John Parker Jr.’s <em>Once a Runner, </em>the very story I discounted six\nyears prior. Many runners hail Parker’s novel as “the best book ever written\nabout running” (it says that on the cover though, so the critical thinker in me\ntook that with a fist-sized grain of salt). Maybe I had been missing some\nsecret this whole time, and somewhere in 250 pages lay some sentiment that would\nelectrify the end of my collegiate running career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a week, this book melted my skepticism. I was in love. The way Parker created a fictional world of a collegiate distance runner that felt realer than anything was like nothing I had ever read before. This book <em>understood me</em>. Everything from the pre-race jitters to the unspoken politics of track teams, from the annoyance of being constantly confused with “health-nuts” to the subtle unease of skipping a training day, and most importantly, the constant drive to improve and the mysterious, unnameable source of that drive, was <em>there</em> and expressed succinctly, almost poetically. It was as if some distant, unknown cousin came for a surprise visit and started showing me grainy photographs of long-lost family members resembling me. Parker’s book was new to me and from a completely different time, but at the same time the little touches that adorned every aspect of his world felt eerily familiar, like I had seen them a thousand times over without ever bothering to put a name to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a quick account of the book hopefully low on spoilers,\nParker, a former mile champion himself, pens a fictional tale of an avatar of\nhimself: Quenton Cassidy, a talented, self-deprecating yet delightfully cocky miler\nentering his senior year in Florida’s fictional Southeastern University in the\nearly 70’s. The book takes a simultaneously irreverent and deadly serious look\ninside Cassidy’s mind as he prepares for his final year of track. Unfortunately,\nfor reasons I’ll not disclose here, Cassidy, in the shape of his life, gets banned\nfrom competition in the spring. In the midst of a challenge completely\nunrelated to running, Cassidy faces a choice: change his lifestyle completely\nin order to continue his pursuit of running perfection, or accept the hand\ndealt to him and walk away quietly to a life without competitive running. If\nyou could guess, he choses the former, isolates himself in a desolate cabin in the\nwoods, and triples his efforts in pursuit of becoming the perfect miler.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>            This book lit my soul on fire in January, and that flame warded me against laziness and the winter’s cold. The simplicity and ferocity with which I trained returned to 15-year-old me levels. Running was still the inherently simple, and sometimes painfully mundane task it was six years ago, but I could love it all the same because this book reawakened my passion for that simplicity. This was my last track season, and thanks to Parker and Cassidy, it would be explosive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, it <em>would have been</em> had the world not ceased its rotation before spring break. Alas, like many seniors around the country, the track season I thought to be my magnum opus no longer existed. While this is not meant to be some self-obsessed account of why this pandemic specifically harms <em>me,</em> an upper-middle class college student with no health problems or compromised family members, hopefully you can understand and relate to my disappointment, if only a little bit. Running’s purist beauty, after two months, became poisoned with extraneous hardships and complexity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with the similar choice as Cassidy, I wasn’t ready\nto quit in the face of adversity. I was in great shape, the product of four months\nof excellently consistent training and four years of equally consistent suffering.\nWhy stop now? My valiant quarantine training commenced! I scheduled a time\ntrial with my roommates. I held the intensity of my training afloat as best I\ncould with a growing tidal wave of apathy lurking in the background. This was\nsimply another test, right? Just as Cassidy states during a particularly difficult\nbout of overtraining, “from the crucible of such inner turmoil comes the\nvarious metals, soft or brittle, flawed or pure, that determine the good\nrunners, the great runners, and perhaps the former runners.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Loosely translated; if you don’t keep training just because your precious little season got cancelled, you’re a fraud. Quarantine hadn’t changed running, just everything else around it. The bleachers had been stripped of your audience, your efforts lost the promise of medals and ribbons, and your training lost the levity brought by training partners. Running is still there though, and if you don’t love it at its worst, you don’t deserve it at its best *<em>vomits*.</em> Your training should have the same, nay, double the intensity it did before or else you weren’t a true believer, just some tourist experimenting with the life of a true runner for a couple years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curiously enough, I’m a fraud. Physically poised to run a 5k time-trial that I thought would be the first of a lengthy “Quarantine Racing Series,” I toed the line at the track one March afternoon feeling oddly tired, and just a bit bored. A tad over 2k in, that boredom evolved to intolerable discomfort and crushing disinterest, so I stepped of the track, sat in the sandpit, and untied my spikes. Four days later, I couldn’t imagine keeping up any form of training, and declared a hiatus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confused, frustrated, and just plain <em>tired</em>, I picked <em>Once a Runner</em> off my desk to try and rekindle the spark. This book is a cult classic beloved by millions. It couldn’t be meaningless, could it? There had to be something in this fiction that was real, irrefutable, and constant: some golden truth that I needed to reconsult to give my struggle meaning again. This time, I read closer, scrutinizing themes and ideas more deeply than the first time around. I even wrote down important quotes accompanied by page numbers (<em>please clap).</em> I left not disappointed, but with a wildly different impression. Without giving too much away for any of you who haven’t read it (a condition I still think you should fix), I left the second read with three key flaws in the book I previously thought perfect. After a brief online search, it seems that these criticisms aren’t anything new. So, to summarize those flaws:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>This book glorifies overtraining.</strong> When I brought up the superhuman volume of Cassidy’s training to my roommate, he countered with “It was the 70’s man, everybody trained like that.” Upon my first read, yes, Cassidy’s constant 140-mile weeks (in preparation to race a <em>mile,</em> mind you) stood out as ridiculous. However, upon a second read, the issue runs deeper than a miler doing double the necessary mileage. When Cassidy begins suffering physically from increasing his mileage (sleeping 14 hours a day, eating poorly, feeling depressed and irritable, ignoring his girlfriend, and skipping class) he throws out some macho 9<sup>th</sup> grade one-liners about how overtraining is a necessary part of the process: Cassidy’s “Trial of Miles.” The book presents an uncompromising message towards training. The “secret” to success is running a lot, pretty fast (about 6 min/mile), twice every day, without any days off. If you can’t commit to that, you suck and you’re wasting your time. Cassidy’s idol and coach, Bruce Denton, runs twice a day through a sickness that leaves him bedridden and puking for the rest of the day. Cassidy trains similarly and never suffers an injury or underperforms in a race (his slowest mile race in the book is about 4:03). How convenient. Cassidy’s infamous interval workout (which lies in one of the best written chapters so I won’t spoil what it is), demands paces and volume that make a training montage from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> look realistic. Cassidy, Denton, and their teammate Jerry Mizner, train like insufferable morons for the entire book. Don’t read this looking for training advice.</li><li><strong>This book’s main theme has sexist undertones. </strong>When I first read this book, I saw some of the sexism in it and wrote it off. It’s set in the Deep South in the 70’s, so I expected some of it. But I’m not talking about how the school football coach is a womanizer (his name is Dick Doobey, I’d be surprised if he wasn’t), nor am I talking about how the jocks single out “ugly girls” to cheat off of during exams, or about that bizarre, glancing sentence where Cassidy kisses a random nurse on the forehead before sprinting away and we’re supposed to think he\'s some charming rogue for it. I don’t mind the first two because the football establishment and its members are villains and villains are prone to, well, villainy. The third is obnoxious, and there’s loads of minuscule, one-off sentences like it where a woman is reduced to “a sweet thing” or some other outdated one-liner that could have been omitted without any consequence to the story. The larger, possibly unforgivable offense lies in the writing of Cassidy’s girlfriend Andrea, the only female character given more than ten lines of dialogue. Andrea spends the book trying to understand Cassidy and his spiritual desire to test his limits, but she can’t. Why? Because Parker finds his only female character more useful as an obstacle than a support. Andrea exists solely to provide a running-free foil to Cassidy in his running-centric world. She symbolizes a distraction, not evil but frivolous, something that stands in Cassidy’s pursuit of athletic prowess. It’s no coincidence Parker wrote Andrea with a limp. She’s written as an earthbound pedestrian trying desperately to understand space flight. She gets reduced to a trial that Cassidy must overcome, because how could the pursuit of greatness <em>ever</em> be understood by <em>*gasps* </em>a <em>woman</em>?</li><li><strong>This book’s specificity can be alienating. </strong>Just as Andrea, a non-runner, gets blown sideways in the wake of Cassidy’s fast-track to glory, so too does anyone running for any reason other than winning races.

This book is a cult classic beloved by millions. It couldn’t be meaningless, could it? There had to be something in this fiction that was real, irrefutable, and constant: some golden truth that I needed to reconsult to give my struggle meaning again. This time, I read closer, scrutinizing themes and ideas more deeply than the first time around. I even wrote down important quotes accompanied by page numbers (<em>please clap).</em> I left not disappointed, but with a wildly different impression. Without giving too much away for any of you who haven’t read it (a condition I still think you should fix), I left the second read with three key flaws in the book I previously thought perfect. After a brief online search, it seems that these criticisms aren’t anything new. So, to summarize those flaws:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>This book glorifies overtraining.</strong> When I brought up the superhuman volume of Cassidy’s training to my roommate, he countered with “It was the 70’s man, everybody trained like that.” Upon my first read, yes, Cassidy’s constant 140-mile weeks (in preparation to race a <em>mile,</em> mind you) stood out as ridiculous. However, upon a second read, the issue runs deeper than a miler doing double the necessary mileage. When Cassidy begins suffering physically from increasing his mileage (sleeping 14 hours a day, eating poorly, feeling depressed and irritable, ignoring his girlfriend, and skipping class) he throws out some macho 9<sup>th</sup> grade one-liners about how overtraining is a necessary part of the process: Cassidy’s “Trial of Miles.” The book presents an uncompromising message towards training. The “secret” to success is running a lot, pretty fast (about 6 min/mile), twice every day, without any days off. If you can’t commit to that, you suck and you’re wasting your time. Cassidy’s idol and coach, Bruce Denton, runs twice a day through a sickness that leaves him bedridden and puking for the rest of the day. Cassidy trains similarly and never suffers an injury or underperforms in a race (his slowest mile race in the book is about 4:03). How convenient. Cassidy’s infamous interval workout (which lies in one of the best written chapters so I won’t spoil what it is), demands paces and volume that make a training montage from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> look realistic. Cassidy, Denton, and their teammate Jerry Mizner, train like insufferable morons for the entire book. Don’t read this looking for training advice.</li><li><strong>This book’s main theme has sexist undertones. </strong>When I first read this book, I saw some of the sexism in it and wrote it off. It’s set in the Deep South in the 70’s, so I expected some of it. But I’m not talking about how the school football coach is a womanizer (his name is Dick Doobey, I’d be surprised if he wasn’t), nor am I talking about how the jocks single out “ugly girls” to cheat off of during exams, or about that bizarre, glancing sentence where Cassidy kisses a random nurse on the forehead before sprinting away and we’re supposed to think he\'s some charming rogue for it. I don’t mind the first two because the football establishment and its members are villains and villains are prone to, well, villainy. The third is obnoxious, and there’s loads of minuscule, one-off sentences like it where a woman is reduced to “a sweet thing” or some other outdated one-liner that could have been omitted without any consequence to the story. The larger, possibly unforgivable offense lies in the writing of Cassidy’s girlfriend Andrea, the only female character given more than ten lines of dialogue. Andrea spends the book trying to understand Cassidy and his spiritual desire to test his limits, but she can’t. Why? Because Parker finds his only female character more useful as an obstacle than a support. Andrea exists solely to provide a running-free foil to Cassidy in his running-centric world. She symbolizes a distraction, not evil but frivolous, something that stands in Cassidy’s pursuit of athletic prowess. It’s no coincidence Parker wrote Andrea with a limp. She’s written as an earthbound pedestrian trying desperately to understand space flight. She gets reduced to a trial that Cassidy must overcome, because how could the pursuit of greatness <em>ever</em> be understood by <em>*gasps* </em>a <em>woman</em>?</li><li><strong>This book’s specificity can be alienating. </strong>Just as Andrea, a non-runner, gets blown sideways in the wake of Cassidy’s fast-track to glory, so too does anyone running for any reason other than winning races. Parker periodically digs at hobby joggers, fitness junkies, “spiritual” or “zen” runners, and anyone else with less than pie-in-the-sky goals. Parker intended this book for competitive runners, and with that comes some elitism and exclusivity. Cassidy’s internal monologue mirrors Parker’s intent: if you’re not “all or nothing”, you’re nothing.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So “the greatest book ever” presents some issues. It’s uncompromising, exclusive, and, shockingly, fictional. What then, draws so many to the tale of Quenton Cassidy? He’s not exactly the most relatable protagonist. He <em>begins</em> the book with a blistering mile PR of 4 minutes. He’s respected, clever, funny, unyieldingly ambitious and, for the most part, invincible. He’s basically a running Superman, and Superman’s perfection makes him less popular than heroes with character flaws. Why do runners look at him like a kindred spirit, when a fraction of a fraction of them possess the talent and drive to exist in his upper echelon of “real runners?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I think the answer is simple. I think that every competitive runner, fast, slow, young, old or injured has either possessed or dreamed of possessing Cassidy’s drive at some point. Heck, forget just runners. Anyone who dreams of being great at anything wishes they could be Cassidy, if only for a little while. He’s a man who gives up everything in pursuit of greatness, and that image is tantalizing. Everyone’s thought it. What if I dropped everything and wrote music all day? What if I quit school to start a business? What if I moved to a cabin in the woods and ran like a madman every day? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It’s a simple idea, removing distractions to maximize your potential, and in the world of fiction our heroes rarely deal with a scenario where it doesn’t pay off because that would spoil the romance. It’s also an idea toyed with by many runners entering this quarantine. With the world closed and commitments shut down, I’ve seen people all over Strava embrace the “all-in” mentality. But for every runner I see busting out ridiculous mileage borne out of boredom, I see another like myself: unmotivated, guilty, and nostalgic for the season that never happened. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In March, we were kicked into isolation that Cassidy chose voluntarily. Some of us adjusted famously. Some took a step back or even stopped training altogether. According to Cassidy, only the former type deserves respect. The rest should be ashamed, and from what I read on Strava while skipping Zoom lectures, many of us are just that: ashamed. When I dropped out of my own time trial four weeks ago I felt acute self-loathing that eventually smoothed out into remorseful frustration which then fizzled into a quiet dissatisfaction that still lingers. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I’d argue that the final of those three qualities is the most useful for fueling a <em>real</em> running journey, one with all the warts and blemishes absent from Cassidy’s pristine journey. I liken self-loathing to an intense dehydration, where you want something so dearly, so <em>immediately</em>, that you’ll do anything to drink some damn water, even if you hurt yourself (not just physically) in the process. On the other hand, quiet dissatisfaction is more like the hunger in the middle of a day when you’ve forgotten to pack a lunch. The slow, smoldering embers of the latter are far more likely to keep you warm and carry you further, while the blazing inferno of the former will burn and burn and burn until you’ve got nothing left but ashes and a hatred for your sport and yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you’ve held to a strict training regimen in the midst of all this chaos, bravo. If instead you wake up in the middle of a global health pandemic without the intense, roiling desire to train your guts out with no races on the near horizon and no teammates to pal around with, and worse, feel <em>guilty</em> about not having the drive anymore, <em>that’s okay.</em> Because, at the risk of Quenton Cassidy rising out of my book and smacking me across the face, it’s okay to not be “all-in” all the time. You can fulfill yourself without Cassidy’s furious obsession.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Deep down, everyone <em>wants </em>their running career to be Cassidy-esque even if they haven’t read the book. What you might forget when you’re caught up in either the book or your own head after a failed workout, is that more than just <em>gumption </em>separates you from Cassidy. Rather, you could train with the same ferocity and single-mindedness he does and still come up short. That’s a result of living in the <em>real world</em>, where injuries are real, overtraining is real, <em>you</em> are real, and where <em>global health pandemics</em> are real. In this real world, though you may be isolated like second-half Quenton Cassidy, it’s okay to be first-half Quenton Cassidy, who pulls pranks, who leads an exciting love life, who gets his training in but is willing to adjust so he can enjoy the weekends with his friends (though I suppose you shouldn’t be doing that last one). Don’t obsess, just live your life the way you want and let the running come naturally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nevertheless, I can still love this book <em>and</em> forgive myself for taking a break from my training during quarantine, and that’s because the magic of <em>Once a Runner</em> lies not in its social commentary or utility as a training guide. If that were true, you’d see competitive runners spitting on joggers out on the sidewalk whilst training themselves to death, and almost all of them would still end up unsatisfied with their own lives because not all of them could be the best. Bleak, right? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>Once a Runner</em>’s timeless power, the power that draws emotion out of so many, is the vivid life it brings to the unspoken laws and details that litter the corners of our lives. Cassidy sleeps in his running clothes to save extra time in the morning and yet he <em>still</em> despises every second of waking up for a run. He and his teammates give their routes goofy names and talk ridiculous hypotheticals to pass the time while running. He’s got every pair of spikes he’s ever raced in saved in a box under his bed, each with their own stories. Knowing that millions of people understand what it’s like to spend your day doing something so simple without imagining doing it any differently, knowing that they understand<em> that</em> alongside every other minuscule habit that links us all together gives this tale the power to tell the reader “you’re not alone,” even when we’re all locked away in our own corners of the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Read the book if you’re interested.

Cassidy trains similarly and never suffers an injury or underperforms in a race (his slowest mile race in the book is about 4:03). How convenient. Cassidy’s infamous interval workout (which lies in one of the best written chapters so I won’t spoil what it is), demands paces and volume that make a training montage from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> look realistic. Cassidy, Denton, and their teammate Jerry Mizner, train like insufferable morons for the entire book. Don’t read this looking for training advice.</li><li><strong>This book’s main theme has sexist undertones. </strong>When I first read this book, I saw some of the sexism in it and wrote it off. It’s set in the Deep South in the 70’s, so I expected some of it. But I’m not talking about how the school football coach is a womanizer (his name is Dick Doobey, I’d be surprised if he wasn’t), nor am I talking about how the jocks single out “ugly girls” to cheat off of during exams, or about that bizarre, glancing sentence where Cassidy kisses a random nurse on the forehead before sprinting away and we’re supposed to think he\'s some charming rogue for it. I don’t mind the first two because the football establishment and its members are villains and villains are prone to, well, villainy. The third is obnoxious, and there’s loads of minuscule, one-off sentences like it where a woman is reduced to “a sweet thing” or some other outdated one-liner that could have been omitted without any consequence to the story. The larger, possibly unforgivable offense lies in the writing of Cassidy’s girlfriend Andrea, the only female character given more than ten lines of dialogue. Andrea spends the book trying to understand Cassidy and his spiritual desire to test his limits, but she can’t. Why? Because Parker finds his only female character more useful as an obstacle than a support. Andrea exists solely to provide a running-free foil to Cassidy in his running-centric world. She symbolizes a distraction, not evil but frivolous, something that stands in Cassidy’s pursuit of athletic prowess. It’s no coincidence Parker wrote Andrea with a limp. She’s written as an earthbound pedestrian trying desperately to understand space flight. She gets reduced to a trial that Cassidy must overcome, because how could the pursuit of greatness <em>ever</em> be understood by <em>*gasps* </em>a <em>woman</em>?</li><li><strong>This book’s specificity can be alienating. </strong>Just as Andrea, a non-runner, gets blown sideways in the wake of Cassidy’s fast-track to glory, so too does anyone running for any reason other than winning races. Parker periodically digs at hobby joggers, fitness junkies, “spiritual” or “zen” runners, and anyone else with less than pie-in-the-sky goals. Parker intended this book for competitive runners, and with that comes some elitism and exclusivity. Cassidy’s internal monologue mirrors Parker’s intent: if you’re not “all or nothing”, you’re nothing.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So “the greatest book ever” presents some issues.

Anyone who dreams of being great at anything wishes they could be Cassidy, if only for a little while. He’s a man who gives up everything in pursuit of greatness, and that image is tantalizing.

As a scrawny sophomore, I still wore white knee-length compression shorts under my uniform split shorts because the sight of my own thighs crippled me with anxiety. Even as an insecure 15-year-old, nothing instilled confidence in myself more than my running. The sweet spot of my career, that first year when you start taking your training seriously and it pays off, had begun. I PR’ed in almost every race I entered as a sophomore and looked towards my first state championship unfazed by the challenge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As such, when my two coaches huddled my team in a science classroom after practice a few days before the state meet to give us a pep talk, I almost fell asleep. I didn’t need any extra motivation. Why would I? Running was simple; you show up, you do your best, and your best comes out. The ignorance borne of youth and absence of adversity made me invincible. Why were we taking an extra twenty minutes to “inspire” ourselves after practice when I could be studying for pre-calc or playing <em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em>? (My time was precious, you see).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When my coach began reading us an excerpt from some popular running book, I rolled my eyes and checked out. How could anyone possibly write an entire book about something so mundane, so easy, and so mind-numbingly singular? Three days later, further supporting my theory that I knew everything and had figured out the secrets of life at 15 years old, I ran a PR at the state championship and earned a top 25 medal. Running’s easy, keep your books to yourself!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Six years, four major injuries, and countless heartbreaking workouts and disappointing races later, I saw myself preparing for my last collegiate track season a tad fed up with running poorly. A novel idea arose; maybe my incredibly experienced coach knew what she was talking about. Whilst shopping for Christmas presents, I figured I’d splurge on a little something for myself: a copy of John Parker Jr.’s <em>Once a Runner, </em>the very story I discounted six years prior. Many runners hail Parker’s novel as “the best book ever written about running” (it says that on the cover though, so the critical thinker in me took that with a fist-sized grain of salt). Maybe I had been missing some secret this whole time, and somewhere in 250 pages lay some sentiment that would electrify the end of my collegiate running career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a week, this book melted my skepticism. I was in love. The way Parker created a fictional world of a collegiate distance runner that felt realer than anything was like nothing I had ever read before. This book <em>understood me</em>. Everything from the pre-race jitters to the unspoken politics of track teams, from the annoyance of being constantly confused with “health-nuts” to the subtle unease of skipping a training day, and most importantly, the constant drive to improve and the mysterious, unnameable source of that drive, was <em>there</em> and expressed succinctly, almost poetically. It was as if some distant, unknown cousin came for a surprise visit and started showing me grainy photographs of long-lost family members resembling me. Parker’s book was new to me and from a completely different time, but at the same time the little touches that adorned every aspect of his world felt eerily familiar, like I had seen them a thousand times over without ever bothering to put a name to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a quick account of the book hopefully low on spoilers, Parker, a former mile champion himself, pens a fictional tale of an avatar of himself: Quenton Cassidy, a talented, self-deprecating yet delightfully cocky miler entering his senior year in Florida’s fictional Southeastern University in the early 70’s. The book takes a simultaneously irreverent and deadly serious look inside Cassidy’s mind as he prepares for his final year of track. Unfortunately, for reasons I’ll not disclose here, Cassidy, in the shape of his life, gets banned from competition in the spring. In the midst of a challenge completely unrelated to running, Cassidy faces a choice: change his lifestyle completely in order to continue his pursuit of running perfection, or accept the hand dealt to him and walk away quietly to a life without competitive running. If you could guess, he chooses the former, isolates himself in a desolate cabin in the woods, and triples his efforts in pursuit of becoming the perfect miler.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This book lit my soul on fire in January, and that flame warded me against laziness and the winter’s cold. The simplicity and ferocity with which I trained returned to 15-year-old me levels. Running was still the inherently simple, and sometimes painfully mundane task it was six years ago, but I could love it all the same because this book reawakened my passion for that simplicity. This was my last track season, and thanks to Parker and Cassidy, it would be explosive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That is, it <em>would have been</em> had the world not ceased its rotation before spring break. Alas, like many seniors around the country, the track season I thought to be my magnum opus no longer existed. While this is not meant to be some self-obsessed account of why this pandemic specifically harms <em>me,</em> an upper-middle class college student with no health problems or compromised family members, hopefully you can understand and relate to my disappointment, if only a little bit. Running’s purist beauty, after two months, became poisoned with extraneous hardships and complexity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Faced with the similar choice as Cassidy, I wasn’t ready to quit in the face of adversity. I was in great shape, the product of four months of excellently consistent training and four years of equally consistent suffering. Why stop now? My valiant quarantine training commenced! I scheduled a time trial with my roommates. I held the intensity of my training afloat as best I could with a growing tidal wave of apathy lurking in the background. This was simply another test, right? Just as Cassidy states during a particularly difficult bout of overtraining, “from the crucible of such inner turmoil comes the various metals, soft or brittle, flawed or pure, that determine the good runners, the great runners, and perhaps the former runners.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Loosely translated; if you don’t keep training just because your precious little season got cancelled, you’re a fraud. Quarantine hadn’t changed running, just everything else around it. The bleachers had been stripped of your audience, your efforts lost the promise of medals and ribbons, and your training lost the levity brought by training partners. Running is still there though, and if you don’t love it at its worst, you don’t deserve it at its best *<em>vomits*.</em> Your training should have the same, nay, double the intensity it did before or else you weren’t a true believer, just some tourist experimenting with the life of a true runner for a couple years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Curiously enough, I’m a fraud. Physically poised to run a 5k time-trial that I thought would be the first of a lengthy “Quarantine Racing Series,” I toed the line at the track one March afternoon feeling oddly tired, and just a bit bored. A tad over 2k in, that boredom evolved to intolerable discomfort and crushing disinterest, so I stepped of the track, sat in the sandpit, and untied my spikes. Four days later, I couldn’t imagine keeping up any form of training, and declared a hiatus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Confused, frustrated, and just plain <em>tired</em>, I picked <em>Once a Runner</em> off my desk to try and rekindle the spark. This book is a cult classic beloved by millions. It couldn’t be meaningless, could it? There had to be something in this fiction that was real, irrefutable, and constant: some golden truth that I needed to reconsult to give my struggle meaning again. This time, I read closer, scrutinizing themes and ideas more deeply than the first time around. I even wrote down important quotes accompanied by page numbers (<em>please clap).</em> I left not disappointed, but with a wildly different impression. Without giving too much away for any of you who haven’t read it (a condition I still think you should fix), I left the second read with three key flaws in the book I previously thought perfect. After a brief online search, it seems that these criticisms aren’t anything new. So, to summarize those flaws:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>This book glorifies overtraining.</strong> When I brought up the superhuman volume of Cassidy’s training to my roommate, he countered with “It was the 70’s man, everybody trained like that.” Upon my first read, yes, Cassidy’s constant 140-mile weeks (in preparation to race a <em>mile,</em> mind you) stood out as ridiculous. However, upon a second read, the issue runs deeper than a miler doing double the necessary mileage. When Cassidy begins suffering physically from increasing his mileage (sleeping 14 hours a day, eating poorly, feeling depressed and irritable, ignoring his girlfriend, and skipping class) he throws out some macho 9<sup>th</sup> grade one-liners about how overtraining is a necessary part of the process: Cassidy’s “Trial of Miles.” The book presents an uncompromising message towards training. The “secret” to success is running a lot, pretty fast (about 6 min/mile), twice every day, without any days off. If you can’t commit to that, you suck and you’re wasting your time. Cassidy’s idol and coach, Bruce Denton, runs twice a day through a sickness that leaves him bedridden and puking for the rest of the day. Cassidy trains similarly and never suffers an injury or underperforms in a race (his slowest mile race in the book is about 4:03). How convenient. Cassidy’s infamous interval workout (which lies in one of the best written chapters so I won’t spoil what it is), demands paces and volume that make a training montage from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> look realistic.

I responded, “Of course not”—as an intern, being confused and asking questions was practically my job description. If someone seemed smarter than me, well, they were supposed to be; I didn’t even have my degree yet, much less work experience in the field.<br><br>You’d think I’d have the same attitude at my first Club Running practice freshman year. However, this would make too much sense. After graduating as the fastest, most dedicated distance runner in my tiny 2A high school—a year where I finally beat my one-sided rival in the 3200 m, set a school record, and medaled at states—I was the slowest person on the team. It was a classic case of the overachiever falling from their overinflated ego throne, and I was bruised badly.<br><br>I decided to take a break from running (it hurt my knees anyways) and tried to find a different hobby. Despite doing my time with club swim, k-pop dance club, ballet club #1, ballet club #2, hip hop dance club, and club rowing, I regressed back to running by my second semester at college. All alone on my runs, I would avoid making eye contact with any club runners, ashamed of my failed two weeks at practice the previous fall. Occasionally, I would read the club email and reminisce about what could have been, thinking about how much I missed track meets. I even attended our home meet, where I sat with my then-girlfriend 10 meters away from the UMD tent until it was time to run my event, in which I was outkicked by some unattached middle schooler.<br><br>By summertime, I’d had enough. My friends refused to get dragged along on the shortest of runs, and I’d cried tears of joy watching <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37965/Kaze_ga_Tsuyoku_Fuiteiru\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Run With the Wind</a> too many times. The prospect of re-joining Club Running was terrifying, but the thought of another semester without a running team was even worse. So, I took on an *intense* summer training schedule (running for around an hour whenever I felt like it) and eagerly awaited the start of the season.<br><br>The second time around was no less painful than the first. I was still the slowest person in workouts, at meets, and on easy runs. There were freshmen who’d barely done the sport that were faster than me. Thanks to stress eating diner cookies, I’d gained 30 lbs, which made me feel like I didn’t even look the part. But, I really, really, really wanted to run with a team again, so I ignored all of this and showed up to practice anyways. Luckily, it’s hard to think about insecurities while doing a hard workout at 6 am, and I had a lot of fun despite sometimes feeling out of place.<br><br>Throughout this time, I desperately wanted someone close to my ability level to run with. I expected that getting faster would solve this, but the runners who used to lap me in workouts have since graduated, and I’m often the only girl on the track. Shockingly enough, it turns out that the running demographic isn’t only “girl who runs 7:00 tempo pace” and “girl who runs 6:00 tempo pace.” There are so many ways to enjoy running that it’s hard to find a group that will perfectly fit your needs. But, this is club running, without any tryouts, fitness requirements, or attendance policies. If you run, jog, or walk (or even if you don’t do any of these things, as my frequently injured self can attest), you can show up to practice or sign up for a meet. There is community in running with others, but there is also community in car rides to meets, cross training, and chatting after practice. Having been so embarrassed of my abilities that I avoided club running to a comical degree, it makes me sad to hear about anyone in a similar situation. It’s normal to feel apprehensive about your fitness; please don’t let it stop you from joining the club.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Local Woman Terrified of Fast Runners; Runs Anyways', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'local-woman-terrified-of-fast-runners-runs-anyways', '', '', '2022-01-04 11:28:23', '2022-01-04 16:28:23', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=478', 0, 'post', '', 0);

I decided to try outdoor track that year. After dropping impressive times of 6:05 in the 1600m and 2:49 in the 800m I decided that I should probably stick with it. As my high school career progressed, I fell in love with the sport and improved quite a bit. Don’t get me wrong I was still extremely mid as a runner, but going into college, I wanted to compete seriously.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I joined club running at the first opportunity and truly wanted to compete at a high level with the club. However, quite simply, this was not meant to be. I was ruthlessly sidelined by injury my freshman year. First, severe food poisoning from the Moby Dick Kabob in Stamp that required me to get saline pumped into my arm in October. This incident was shortly followed by a season ending stress fracture in my shin. I was healthy to start the Spring semester until I broke my shoulder causing me to miss the first half of track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These injuries did not turn me away from running, but it did change how I viewed it. I no longer really cared about competing or getting fast. I just did it because I liked it. &nbsp;As running became a more casual aspect of my life, central pillars of my personality became intertwined with the activity. Most important of all of these traits was my daftness. I was no longer running to obtain PRs or win races. No. I was running to achieve maximum stupidity. Here is the roadmap to how I became the stupidest runner in Club Running history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2/1/19</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a fateful night in the second semester of my freshman year I broke my shoulder. I am not going to go into specifics on how this happened. It just did. I was informed by doctors that the only physical activity I could do while in my sling was walking. I instantly decided to take this activity to the extreme.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I began training in the art of speed walking. This included tempo walks, fartlek walks, and long walks. This is when I started to become stupid. The first stupid physical activity I ever did was probably a 12:42 pace 10-mile walk done around lake artemisia on 12/17/2019. While completing this event I had an idea. I was going to power walk a 5k around lake artemisia and it was going to happen that Friday. The goal was sub 30 minutes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2/22/19</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I showed up to practice on a beautiful Friday afternoon ready for war. I did a warmup walk to the lake then just started freaking ripping it. I had been doing my training alone and out of view from the rest of the team, so no one really knew how fast I had gotten. Club running legend Shannon MacMaster and a few other people were running some lake loops that day and were shocked by my speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I looked like a complete psycho out there. My left arm was tightly wrapped in a sling. My right arm was violently swinging back and forth, and I was breathing HARD. Families were trying to enjoy the nice afternoon having picnics and shit and I would whip past them completely destroying the peaceful vibe of the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After about 2.5 laps of HELL the clock stopped at 29:09. That’s 9:24 per mile. It had hurt worse than any 5k I had ever run. I literally had to lay down in the middle of the trail when it was done to catch my breath.

I decided to try outdoor track that year. After dropping impressive times of 6:05 in the 1600m and 2:49 in the 800m I decided that I should probably stick with it. As my high school career progressed, I fell in love with the sport and improved quite a bit. Don’t get me wrong I was still extremely mid as a runner, but going into college, I wanted to compete seriously.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I joined club running at the first opportunity and truly wanted to compete at a high level with the club. However, quite simply, this was not meant to be. I was ruthlessly sidelined by injury my freshman year. First, severe food poisoning from the Moby Dick Kabob in Stamp that required me to get saline pumped into my arm in October. This incident was shortly followed by a season ending stress fracture in my shin. I was healthy to start the Spring semester until I broke my shoulder causing me to miss the first half of track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These injuries did not turn me away from running, but it did change how I viewed it. I no longer really cared about competing or getting fast. I just did it because I liked it. &nbsp;As running became a more casual aspect of my life, central pillars of my personality became intertwined with the activity. Most important of all of these traits was my daftness. I was no longer running to obtain PRs or win races. No. I was running to achieve maximum stupidity. Here is the roadmap to how I became the stupidest runner in Club Running history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2/1/19</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a fateful night in the second semester of my freshman year I broke my shoulder. I am not going to go into specifics on how this happened. It just did. I was informed by doctors that the only physical activity I could do while in my sling was walking. I instantly decided to take this activity to the extreme.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I began training in the art of speed walking. This included tempo walks, fartlek walks, and long walks. This is when I started to become stupid. The first stupid physical activity I ever did was probably a 12:42 pace 10-mile walk done around lake artemisia on 12/17/2019. While completing this event I had an idea. I was going to power walk a 5k around lake artemisia and it was going to happen that Friday. The goal was sub 30 minutes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2/22/19</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I showed up to practice on a beautiful Friday afternoon ready for war. I did a warmup walk to the lake then just started freaking ripping it. I had been doing my training alone and out of view from the rest of the team, so no one really knew how fast I had gotten. Club running legend Shannon MacMaster and a few other people were running some lake loops that day and were shocked by my speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I looked like a complete psycho out there. My left arm was tightly wrapped in a sling. My right arm was violently swinging back and forth, and I was breathing HARD.

Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800. Rachel enthusiastically ran a time of 3:07 which was faster than her goal of 3:10. Going into the race Diana’s goal was to run sub 3:30. Diana smashed this goal by running 2:41. This puts Diana 8th in club history for the women’s outdoor 800.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similar to the men’s 1500 yesterday the men’s 800 had seemingly endless heats. Andrew Scalese ran a time of 2:37. With no strava to stalk I don’t have much to say about his performance. Nate Lieske was the next finisher. Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants. For the next two 800 runners I have to talk about them together.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>[Insert Chris and Brian Photo]</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian Lau and Chirs Scalzi worked together in their heat of the 800. Both were very pleased with their races and the progress they have been making. Brian ran a time of 2:06 and Chris finished just ahead in 2:04. Jake Muma was our next finisher with a new PR of 2:01. He was hoping for a little faster time, but this race definitely trended in the right direction for Jake. Brian McCullough finished 14th overall with a time of 2:00. I will let the following meme describe Max Worley’s 800.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Heading into the final two events the men’s team with 25 points trailed Pittsburgh with 29 points and Ohio State with 26 points.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gray weather and the chilly steeple pool perfectly matched the all black uniform and black gloves Matthew “Best Drip” Stasiukevicius sported for the final distance race of the meet. In the men’s 3000 steeple Stas looked to close the gap with Pitt and Ohio State. Finishing in a time of 10:37 Stas ran the 5th fastest steeple in club history, placed 7th, and scored 2 points for the team. This sunk Ohio State to the bottom of the steeple pool and put our sights on Pitt with just the men’s 4x400 to go.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had two teams in the men’s 4x400. A freshmen team consisting of Brian Lau, Lucas “Cap” LaBuff, Sam Fields, and Jacob Bush was inexcusably disqualified after running outside of their lane. However, there were some unofficial PRs run. Cap ran a 57s and unofficial PR of one second. Jacob Bush also ran an unofficial PR of 63s. The Maryland “A” team ran the 5th fastest men’s outdoor 4x400 in club history! Max Worley, Konrad Shire, Dom Cardone, and Clay Buckman ran a time of 3:30.52 to place 5th and score a very important 4 points. These points moved the men’s team past Pitt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the final events run the women’s team finished in 10th with 14 points and the men’s team finished 6th with 31 points. Regardless of points, place, or time Maryland Club Running had an extremely successful weekend. Everyone cheered, laughed, and shivered together in support of one another. There are not many college students that would willingly return to campus at 1:30am on a Monday strictly for the purpose of running. But there is a lot more to it than just running. Equally and if not more important is the friendship and comradery that club running gives us. Thanks to these friendships I know many of us would do this all the time if we were given the chance. Running is very important to all of us. But, there is just something about the friends we have met through running which makes it truly special. I want to say thank you to the officers for all their hard work. I also want to thank my teammates and friends for such a fun weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that my emotions are essentially in shambles it is time for some meme reviews.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'NIRCA Track and Field Nationals 2022 Day 2￼', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '541-revision-v1', '', '', '2022-04-12 07:22:13', '2022-04-12 11:22:13', '', 541, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=542', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Over the past few months I\'ve written around 50 poems, and many of them dealt with my relationship to running over the years.

I found myself talking with Elizabeth Allsopp, a relatively new member of club running, during the seemingly infinite heats of the men’s 1500. Perplexed as to why I had a notebook with details about every single club member\'s activities during the day. I explained that I’m injured and instead of competing I am writing a recap about the meet.

I had yet to experience it all the while I heard countless stories of it being sort of a meme. Some say it is because it is too early in the season to matter and some say it’s just part of the meme that is NIRCA. Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members. Despite injuring myself two weeks before nationals I was determined to make the most of my first track nats. So I embraced the spectator role and tried to view as many events as I could.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we get into the recaps I want to preface a few things. Unfortunately due to the questionable layout of the venue I did miss a few events, but they will still be covered. If somebody reads this and doesn’t see their event well sorry I tried my best. Feel free to tell me and I can try to edit it (I think I can at least, Wordpress is weird).

So if there is something wrong in here again feel free to let me know and I will edit it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A perfect place to start is with Elizabeth’s post race interview. Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track. Being an avid swimmer, Elizabeth mistakenly asked someone “what are we swimming?” Reassured by her teammates, Elizabeth soon started her very first 200. Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away. Unfortunately, Elizabeth could not see the clock as she finished. Elizabeth finished her very first 200, which I qualify as a PR, with a time of 37.85s.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>100 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the day the very first athlete to compete was Ben Griffith in the 100m dash.

Nate Lieske described it as a \"dominant performance.\" Sofia\'s best mark came in at 8.64m and good enough for 6th place. A combined total of 4 points helped the lady terps get off to a great start!

Despite being displeased with the time, Lillian was considering it a miracle she was able to finish based on how she felt the night before. Even though she may not have PRed she definitely took home the most watches worn in a race award. Also in the women\'s 5000 was club president Diana Liepinya running a time of 19:36.

Savannah and Simela ran times of 34.73s and 32.83s, respectively. During the post race interview co-200 runner Elizabeth was very complimentary of Simela. However, her other co-200 runner Rachel made fun of her. In heat 2 we have Rachel George who ran a 34.17s. In her post race interview she adamantly noted that she would no longer be pursuing sprinting. Finally, in heat 3 Lila Coffman ran a 29.57s which was enough for her to qualify for the women’s 200 semi-finals!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Shot Put</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had another all-american performance coming from the field athletes. This time courtesy of Henry Sheppard. In Henry\'s first outdoor shot put with the club he broke the club record and then proceeded to break it again.

While the club record remains unbroken they managed a strong effort placing them into the all-american category. Their time of 8:12.45 was enough for 7th place, 2 points, and the second fastest men’s 4x800 in club history!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 5000</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The men\'s 5000 decided to be a machine today producing 5 PRs for our athletes. Getting us started was Adam Cullen who ran a 21:37. Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53. Andrew finished just in front of Tim at 18:49, a track 5000 PR for Andrew. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Discus</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus. Looking to break his own club record and set a new PR, Henry took control of the field and never looked back. Henry matched his PR and the current club record with a throw of 37.37m.

Both in heat 2 Rachel and Anna ran times of 1:17.97 and 1:12.82. Rachel thinks her race could have been better, but also could have been worse. Anna thought she got out too fast. Regardless they both had strong races. Just after qualifying for the women’s 200m semi-finals Lila had another very successful race. Lila ran a time of 1:08.36 which was just 2 places out of all-american status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 400 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the men’s team also had a very successful 400m dash. First up in heat 3 Andrew Scalese made his outdoor debut running a time of 1:07. Next up was another club favorite Frankie Andrews. Frankie ran his 400m in a time of 1:00.58. Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500. Lillian and Anna were back on the track to compete for the lady terps. Anna crossed the line with a time of 6:03 which was a season best for her. With only one watch this time Lillian ran a time of 5:59.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now the men’s team tried their luck in the 1500m. We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Regardless, Jake finished with a time of 4:17. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s and Men\'s 200 Semi-Finals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track. Being an avid swimmer, Elizabeth mistakenly asked someone “what are we swimming?” Reassured by her teammates, Elizabeth soon started her very first 200. Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away. Unfortunately, Elizabeth could not see the clock as she finished. Elizabeth finished her very first 200, which I qualify as a PR, with a time of 37.85s.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the day the very first athlete to compete was Ben Griffith in the 100m dash. In heat two Ben managed fourth place with a time of 14.07s. During a post race interview Ben expressed his distaste for the start, but he was able to make up for it throughout the race. Ben\'s main goal was to be \"here and have fun and I had fun!\"&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next we move to some field events where the field athlete’s very successful weekend started. Sofia Grossman and Savannah Sitler both achieved all-american status in their women\'s shot put competition. Savannah set a new PR with a mark of 6.69m which was good for 8th place. Nate Lieske described it as a \"dominant performance.\" Sofia\'s best mark came in at 8.64m and good enough for 6th place. A combined total of 4 points helped the lady terps get off to a great start! These marks look to be good for first and second place on the club record, but I cannot confirm this due to the unknown current state of the website and/or webmaster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lillian \"The Time Bandit\" Hsu complete with four watches was next to compete in the women\'s 5000. With the help of a crazy kick from 200 out Lillian was able to achieve a time of 20:52. Despite being displeased with the time, Lillian was considering it a miracle she was able to finish based on how she felt the night before. Even though she may not have PRed she definitely took home the most watches worn in a race award. Also in the women\'s 5000 was club president Diana Liepinya running a time of 19:36. Diana was very pleased with her race and noted that she enjoyed having people to run with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up on the track next, other than speed, was the women\'s 200. In this race were Rachel, Elizabeth, Simela, Savannah, and Lila. Up first in heat 1 was Savannah, fresh off her all-american shot put, and Simela Arnold. Savannah and Simela ran times of 34.73s and 32.83s, respectively. During the post race interview co-200 runner Elizabeth was very complimentary of Simela, however, her other co-200 runner Rachel made fun of her. In heat 2 we have Rachel George who ran a 34.17s. In her post race interview she adamantly noted that she would no longer be pursuing sprinting. Finally, in heat 3 Lila Coffman ran a 29.57s which was enough for her to qualify for the women’s 200 semi-finals!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had another all-american performance coming from the field athletes. This time courtesy of Henry Sheppard. In Henry\'s first outdoor shot put with the club he broke the club record and then proceeded to break it again. With a mark of 11.07m Henry achieved second place in the men\'s shot put plus a total of 8 points for the men’s team. However, Henry\'s record setting day was just getting started.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next on the track was Clay Buckman and Dominick Cardone in the men’s 200m dash. In heat 8 Dom ran a 24.57s.

This super team consisted of Max Worley, Brian McCullough, Konrad Shire, and Chris Scalzi. While the club record remains unbroken they managed a strong effort placing them into the all-american category. Their time of 8:12.45 was enough for 7th place, 2 points, and the second fastest men’s 4x800 in club history!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The men\'s 5000 decided to be a machine today producing 5 PRs for our athletes. Getting us started was Adam Cullen who ran a 21:37. Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53 while Andrew finished just in front of him at 18:49, a track 5000 PR. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus. Looking to break his own club record and set a new PR, Henry took control of the field and never looked back. Henry matched his PR and the current club record with a throw of 37.37m. This effort took home first place in the men’s shot put and 10 points for the men’s team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lady terps had another strong showing in the 400 from Rachel George, Anna Schauermann, and Lila Coffman. Both in heat 2 Rachel and Anna ran times of 1:17.97 and 1:12.82. Rachel thinks her race could have been better, but also could have been worse. Anne thought she got out too fast. Regardless they both had strong races. Just after qualifying for the women’s 200m semi-finals Lila had another very successful race. Lila ran a time of 1:08.36 which was just 2 places out of all-american status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the men’s team also had a very successful 400m dash. First up in heat 3 Andrew Scalese made his outdoor debut running a time of 1:07. Next up was another club favorite Frankie Andrews. Frankie ran his 400m in a time of 1:00.58. Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500. Lillian and Anna were back on the track to compete for the lady terps. Anna crossed the line with a time of 6:03 which was a season best for her. With only one watch this time Lillian ran a time of 5:59.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now the men’s team tried their luck in the 1500m. We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track. Being an avid swimmer, Elizabeth mistakenly asked someone “what are we swimming?” Reassured by her teammates, Elizabeth soon started her very first 200. Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away.

Sofia Grossman and Savannah Sitler both achieved all-american status in their women\'s shot put competition. Savannah set a new PR with a mark of 6.69m which was good for 8th place. Nate Lieske described it as a \"dominant performance.\" Sofia\'s best mark came in at 8.64m and good enough for 6th place. A combined total of 4 points helped the lady terps get off to a great start!

Even though she may not have PRed she definitely took home the most watches worn in a race award. Also in the women\'s 5000 was club president Diana Liepinya running a time of 19:36.

Savannah and Simela ran times of 34.73s and 32.83s, respectively. During the post race interview co-200 runner Elizabeth was very complimentary of Simela, however, her other co-200 runner Rachel made fun of her. In heat 2 we have Rachel George who ran a 34.17s.

Getting us started was Adam Cullen who ran a 21:37. Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53 while Andrew finished just in front of him at 18:49, a track 5000 PR. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus. Looking to break his own club record and set a new PR, Henry took control of the field and never looked back. Henry matched his PR and the current club record with a throw of 37.37m. This effort took home first place in the men’s shot put and 10 points for the men’s team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lady terps had another strong showing in the 400 from Rachel George, Anna Schauermann, and Lila Coffman. Both in heat 2 Rachel and Anna ran times of 1:17.97 and 1:12.82. Rachel thinks her race could have been better, but also could have been worse. Anne thought she got out too fast. Regardless they both had strong races. Just after qualifying for the women’s 200m semi-finals Lila had another very successful race. Lila ran a time of 1:08.36 which was just 2 places out of all-american status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the men’s team also had a very successful 400m dash.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500. Lillian and Anna were back on the track to compete for the lady terps. Anna crossed the line with a time of 6:03 which was a season best for her. With only one watch this time Lillian ran a time of 5:59.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now the men’s team tried their luck in the 1500m. We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500.

Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough.

At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members.

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track. Being an avid swimmer, Elizabeth mistakenly asked someone “what are we swimming?” Reassured by her teammates, Elizabeth soon started her very first 200. Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away. Unfortunately, Elizabeth could not see the clock as she finished. Elizabeth finished her very first 200, which I qualify as a PR, with a time of 37.85s.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:verse -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse\">100</pre>\n<!-- /wp:verse -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the day the very first athlete to compete was Ben Griffith in the 100m dash. In heat two Ben managed fourth place with a time of 14.07s. During a post race interview Ben expressed his distaste for the start, but he was able to make up for it throughout the race.

Sofia Grossman and Savannah Sitler both achieved all-american status in their women\'s shot put competition. Savannah set a new PR with a mark of 6.69m which was good for 8th place. Nate Lieske described it as a \"dominant performance.\" Sofia\'s best mark came in at 8.64m and good enough for 6th place. A combined total of 4 points helped the lady terps get off to a great start!

Despite being displeased with the time, Lillian was considering it a miracle she was able to finish based on how she felt the night before. Even though she may not have PRed she definitely took home the most watches worn in a race award. Also in the women\'s 5000 was club president Diana Liepinya running a time of 19:36. Diana was very pleased with her race and noted that she enjoyed having people to run with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up on the track next, other than speed, was the women\'s 200. In this race were Rachel, Elizabeth, Simela, Savannah, and Lila. Up first in heat 1 was Savannah, fresh off her all-american shot put, and Simela Arnold. Savannah and Simela ran times of 34.73s and 32.83s, respectively. During the post race interview co-200 runner Elizabeth was very complimentary of Simela, however, her other co-200 runner Rachel made fun of her. In heat 2 we have Rachel George who ran a 34.17s. In her post race interview she adamantly noted that she would no longer be pursuing sprinting. Finally, in heat 3 Lila Coffman ran a 29.57s which was enough for her to qualify for the women’s 200 semi-finals!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had another all-american performance coming from the field athletes. This time courtesy of Henry Sheppard. In Henry\'s first outdoor shot put with the club he broke the club record and then proceeded to break it again.

However, Henry\'s record setting day was just getting started.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next on the track was Clay Buckman and Dominick Cardone in the men’s 200m dash.

Their time of 8:12.45 was enough for 7th place, 2 points, and the second fastest men’s 4x800 in club history!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The men\'s 5000 decided to be a machine today producing 5 PRs for our athletes. Getting us started was Adam Cullen who ran a 21:37. Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53 while Andrew finished just in front of him at 18:49, a track 5000 PR. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus. Looking to break his own club record and set a new PR, Henry took control of the field and never looked back. Henry matched his PR and the current club record with a throw of 37.37m. This effort took home first place in the men’s shot put and 10 points for the men’s team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lady terps had another strong showing in the 400 from Rachel George, Anna Schauermann, and Lila Coffman.

Regardless they both had strong races. Just after qualifying for the women’s 200m semi-finals Lila had another very successful race. Lila ran a time of 1:08.36 which was just 2 places out of all-american status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the men’s team also had a very successful 400m dash. First up in heat 3 Andrew Scalese made his outdoor debut running a time of 1:07. Next up was another club favorite Frankie Andrews. Frankie ran his 400m in a time of 1:00.58. Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500. Lillian and Anna were back on the track to compete for the lady terps. Anna crossed the line with a time of 6:03 which was a season best for her. With only one watch this time Lillian ran a time of 5:59.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now the men’s team tried their luck in the 1500m. We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race.

Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s.

We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR.

Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s.

Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough.

Some say it is because it is too early in the season to matter and some say it’s just part of the meme that is NIRCA. Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members. Despite injuring myself two weeks before nationals I was determined to make the most of my first track nats.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s.

We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s and Men\'s 200 Semi-Finals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough.

Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48.

Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s.

Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR.

Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s.

Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier.

I found myself talking with Elizabeth Allsopp, a relatively new member of club running, during the seemingly infinite heats of the men’s 1500. Perplexed as to why I had a notebook with details about every single club member\'s activities during the day. I explained that I’m injured and instead of competing I am writing a recap about the meet.

I had yet to experience it all the while I heard countless stories of it being sort of a meme. Some say it is because it is too early in the season to matter and some say it’s just part of the meme that is NIRCA. Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members. Despite injuring myself two weeks before nationals I was determined to make the most of my first track nats. So I embraced the spectator role and tried to view as many events as I could.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we get into the recaps I want to preface a few things.

Feel free to tell me and I can try to edit it (I think I can at least, Wordpress is weird).

Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away. Unfortunately, Elizabeth could not see the clock as she finished.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s.

We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s and Men\'s 200 Semi-Finals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s and Men\'s 200 Semi-Finals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

While the club record remains unbroken they managed a strong effort placing them into the all-american category. Their time of 8:12.45 was enough for 7th place, 2 points, and the second fastest men’s 4x800 in club history!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 5000</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The men\'s 5000 decided to be a machine today producing 5 PRs for our athletes.

Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53 while Andrew finished just in front of him at 18:49, a track 5000 PR. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Discus</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus.

Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500.

We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough.

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track.

Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away.

I had yet to experience it all the while I heard countless stories of it being sort of a meme. Some say it is because it is too early in the season to matter and some say it’s just part of the meme that is NIRCA. Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members. Despite injuring myself two weeks before nationals I was determined to make the most of my first track nats. So I embraced the spectator role and tried to view as many events as I could.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we get into the recaps I want to preface a few things.

Feel free to tell me and I can try to edit it (I think I can at least, Wordpress is weird).

I found myself talking with Elizabeth Allsopp, a relatively new member of club running, during the seemingly infinite heats of the men’s 1500. Perplexed as to why I had a notebook with details about every single club member\'s activities during the day.

I had yet to experience it all the while I heard countless stories of it being sort of a meme. Some say it is because it is too early in the season to matter and some say it’s just part of the meme that is NIRCA. Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members. Despite injuring myself two weeks before nationals I was determined to make the most of my first track nats. So I embraced the spectator role and tried to view as many events as I could.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we get into the recaps I want to preface a few things.

Feel free to tell me and I can try to edit it (I think I can at least, Wordpress is weird).

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track. Being an avid swimmer, Elizabeth mistakenly asked someone “what are we swimming?” Reassured by her teammates, Elizabeth soon started her very first 200. Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away. Unfortunately, Elizabeth could not see the clock as she finished. Elizabeth finished her very first 200, which I qualify as a PR, with a time of 37.85s.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>100 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the day the very first athlete to compete was Ben Griffith in the 100m dash.

Nate Lieske described it as a \"dominant performance.\" Sofia\'s best mark came in at 8.64m and good enough for 6th place. A combined total of 4 points helped the lady terps get off to a great start!

Despite being displeased with the time, Lillian was considering it a miracle she was able to finish based on how she felt the night before. Even though she may not have PRed she definitely took home the most watches worn in a race award. Also in the women\'s 5000 was club president Diana Liepinya running a time of 19:36. Diana was very pleased with her race and noted that she enjoyed having people to run with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 200 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up on the track next, other than speed, was the women\'s 200.

Savannah and Simela ran times of 34.73s and 32.83s, respectively. During the post race interview co-200 runner Elizabeth was very complimentary of Simela. However, her other co-200 runner Rachel made fun of her. In heat 2 we have Rachel George who ran a 34.17s. In her post race interview she adamantly noted that she would no longer be pursuing sprinting. Finally, in heat 3 Lila Coffman ran a 29.57s which was enough for her to qualify for the women’s 200 semi-finals!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Shot Put</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had another all-american performance coming from the field athletes. This time courtesy of Henry Sheppard. In Henry\'s first outdoor shot put with the club he broke the club record and then proceeded to break it again. With a mark of 11.07m Henry achieved second place in the men\'s shot put plus a total of 8 points for the men’s team. However, Henry\'s record setting day was just getting started.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 200 Prelims</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next on the track was Clay Buckman and Dominick Cardone in the men’s 200m dash.

This super team consisted of Max Worley, Brian McCullough, Konrad Shire, and Chris Scalzi. While the club record remains unbroken they managed a strong effort placing them into the all-american category. Their time of 8:12.45 was enough for 7th place, 2 points, and the second fastest men’s 4x800 in club history!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 5000</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The men\'s 5000 decided to be a machine today producing 5 PRs for our athletes. Getting us started was Adam Cullen who ran a 21:37. Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53. Andrew finished just in front of Tim at 18:49, a track 5000 PR for Andrew. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Discus</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus. Looking to break his own club record and set a new PR, Henry took control of the field and never looked back. Henry matched his PR and the current club record with a throw of 37.37m. This effort took home first place in the men’s shot put and 10 points for the men’s team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 400 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lady terps had another strong showing in the 400 from Rachel George, Anna Schauermann, and Lila Coffman. Both in heat 2 Rachel and Anna ran times of 1:17.97 and 1:12.82. Rachel thinks her race could have been better, but also could have been worse. Anna thought she got out too fast. Regardless they both had strong races. Just after qualifying for the women’s 200m semi-finals Lila had another very successful race. Lila ran a time of 1:08.36 which was just 2 places out of all-american status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 400 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the men’s team also had a very successful 400m dash. First up in heat 3 Andrew Scalese made his outdoor debut running a time of 1:07. Next up was another club favorite Frankie Andrews. Frankie ran his 400m in a time of 1:00.58. Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500. Lillian and Anna were back on the track to compete for the lady terps. Anna crossed the line with a time of 6:03 which was a season best for her. With only one watch this time Lillian ran a time of 5:59.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now the men’s team tried their luck in the 1500m. We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Regardless, Jake finished with a time of 4:17. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s and Men\'s 200 Semi-Finals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500.

We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Regardless, Jake finished with a time of 4:17. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough. With a time of 4:06 Brian was just one place out of all-american status. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s and Men\'s 200 Semi-Finals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two final events of the day were the women’s and men’s 200m semi-finals.

I had yet to experience it all the while I heard countless stories of it being sort of a meme. Some say it is because it is too early in the season to matter and some say it’s just part of the meme that is NIRCA. Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members. Despite injuring myself two weeks before nationals I was determined to make the most of my first track nats. So I embraced the spectator role and tried to view as many events as I could.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we get into the recaps I want to preface a few things.

Most of the information is from notes during the meet, talking with people and athletes themselves, as well as stalking on strava.

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track.

Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away.

Andrew finished just in front of Tim at 18:49, a track 5000 PR for Andrew. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48.

This super team consisted of Max Worley, Brian McCullough, Konrad Shire, and Chris Scalzi. While the club record remains unbroken they managed a strong effort placing them into the all-american category. Their time of 8:12.45 was enough for 7th place, 2 points, and the second fastest men’s 4x800 in club history!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 5000</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The men\'s 5000 decided to be a machine today producing 5 PRs for our athletes. Getting us started was Adam Cullen who ran a 21:37. Two notable kicks from Tim Chu and Andrew Cullen, Adam’s brother, helped them pass the competition and helped Tim PR with a time of 18:53. Andrew finished just in front of Tim at 18:49, a track 5000 PR for Andrew. Club favorite Jacob Bush was another one of our runners with a PR of 17:13. Zach “Hot-Take Factory” Kiedrowski made his presence known with a PR of 17:43. Vice President Sohan Ganatra, with the weight of the world on his shoulder as any ex-club vice president can relate to, ran a time of 16:48. Today’s best 5000 effort came from Sam Fields with a massive 40 second PR giving people in the top two heats, which were run on day 2, a run for their money. Cracking into the top 40 athletes Sam ran a time of 16:05. Notably quiet, I took to strava to find how Sam felt about his performance. In a quintessentially Sam way, he “felt great” about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Discus</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to the field events we had Henry back at it competing in the men’s discus. Looking to break his own club record and set a new PR, Henry took control of the field and never looked back. Henry matched his PR and the current club record with a throw of 37.37m. This effort took home first place in the men’s shot put and 10 points for the men’s team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 400 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lady terps had another strong showing in the 400 from Rachel George, Anna Schauermann, and Lila Coffman. Both in heat 2 Rachel and Anna ran times of 1:17.97 and 1:12.82. Rachel thinks her race could have been better, but also could have been worse. Anna thought she got out too fast. Regardless they both had strong races. Just after qualifying for the women’s 200m semi-finals Lila had another very successful race. Lila ran a time of 1:08.36 which was just 2 places out of all-american status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 400 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the men’s team also had a very successful 400m dash. First up in heat 3 Andrew Scalese made his outdoor debut running a time of 1:07. Next up was another club favorite Frankie Andrews. Frankie ran his 400m in a time of 1:00.58. Frankie described his 400m as “awful, not a lot of fun.” But, Frankie did achieve his goal and challenged the great Ricky Bobby saying, “If you’re not last you’re first.” Our final two athletes in the 400m dash were Clay and Dom. Dom had a strong performance running a 52.09s. This put him just one place out of all-american status. Clay had another all-american performance with a time of 51.01s. Clay placed 4th and scored 5 more points for the men’s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the track next was the women’s 1500. Lillian and Anna were back on the track to compete for the lady terps. Anna crossed the line with a time of 6:03 which was a season best for her. With only one watch this time Lillian ran a time of 5:59.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 1500</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now the men’s team tried their luck in the 1500m. We had a total of 14 athletes in the men’s 1500. Ben Griffith went into the race with a goal of running his first sub 6 1500. Having no experience in the 1500, Ben was excited to run a “free PR.” His goal was achieved with a time of 5:54. In a post race interview Ben was “hype, but the last 100 was comparable to Ohio. Ben had some other stuff to say but unfortunately I could not read my own handwriting. It was something along the lines of thanking Sebs and being hype about sub 6. The next finisher was Andrew Scalese. Andrew used his speed from his earlier 400 to run a time of 5:37. Not even missing his heat to use the bathroom could stop Tim Chu from running his 5:03. Tim knows he can do better but was happy with this effort given running the 5000 earlier in the day. Andrew Cullen was our next finisher with a time of 5:01 which was a new PR! Placing back to back were Nate Lieske and Zach Kiedrowski who ran times of 4:59.52 and 4:49.37. Nate was able to out kick two other athletes and Zach wasn’t expecting much after PRing in the 5000 earlier. Matthew “Nicest Guy Around*” *Not When In Gatlinburg, TN Sebsibe was next to finish the men’s 1500 with a time of 4:47. Even with limited training this could possibly be a PR. Jacob “Your Mom’s Favorite Club Runner” Bush finished his 1500 with a new PR of 4:47. Fresh off his massive 5000 performance, Sam Fields ran a time of 4:35.70. Finishing just one place in front of Sam was Lucas “Cap” Labuff with a time of 4:35.60. Nick Gonzalez was the next to PR with a time of 4:27. In a post race interview Nick described his race. Nick noted that he went out too fast and was worried about the rest of the race. But just like your Mom he thought of Jacob Bush and some primal instinct took over pushing him forward. Since Nick had done no speed work leading up to this race he was very happy with his performance. Seeded at 4:20.69 Brian Lau was the next athlete to finish the 1500. Brian was happy with his time of 4:23 noting that there was a definite room for improvement in racing strategy. Next was Jake Muma running some sort of PR. I am not really sure what type of PR he was talking about. His strava mentioned a SR, unofficial PR, and a “huge” meet PR. Not sure how you can have a meet PR at nationals as a freshmen, but I am probably just misunderstanding. Regardless, Jake finished with a time of 4:17. Finally, our last finisher for the men’s 1500 was Brian McCullough.

Amid the usual pre race butterflies Elizabeth found herself wondering if a 200 is halfway around the track. Being an avid swimmer, Elizabeth mistakenly asked someone “what are we swimming?” Reassured by her teammates, Elizabeth soon started her very first 200. Almost without warning Elizabeth found herself running. She noted the cool air hitting her face and people stretching out beyond her. As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away.

Nate Lieske described it as a \"dominant performance.\" Sofia\'s best mark came in at 8.64m and good enough for 6th place. A combined total of 4 points helped the lady terps get off to a great start!

As she came around the curve she worried about people seeing her and internally or externally, which one remains unclear, expressed herself with an “ahhhhh.” As Frankie with the camera came into view she realized that the finish line was still very far away. Unfortunately, Elizabeth could not see the clock as she finished. Elizabeth finished her very first 200, which I qualify as a PR, with a time of 37.85s.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>100 Meter Dash</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier in the day the very first athlete to compete was Ben Griffith in the 100m dash.

Regardless, I know track nats hold a special place in many club alumni’s hearts and the few current members who have been present in the past. At the same time it has only been a figure of imagination for many of the club’s current members.

We boarded the bus on another chilly and rainy Michigan morning. All one square mile of Olivet proper passed us by as most of us pass through for probably the last time in our lives.

Despite dealing with some illness Gabe Worthington finished with a time of 16:36. In no time Gabe will have his immune system under control and he will be back running times he knows he can. Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Plante. In his first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts from afar. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record!

Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman.

Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman.

After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record!

After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day.

Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman.

Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

There are not many college students that would willingly return to campus at 1:30am on a Monday strictly for the purpose of running. But there is a lot more to it than just running. Equally and if not more important is the friendship and comradery that club running gives us. Thanks to these friendships I know many of us would do this all the time if we were given the chance. Running is very important to all of us. But, there is just something about the friends we have met through running which makes it truly special.

Max Worley, Konrad Shire, Dom Cardone, and Clay Buckman ran a time of 3:30.52 to place 5th and score a very important 4 points. These points moved the men’s team past Pitt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the final events run the women’s team finished in 10th with 14 points and the men’s team finished 6th with 31 points. Regardless of points, place, or time Maryland Club Running had an extremely successful weekend. Everyone cheered, laughed, and shivered together in support of one another. There are not many college students that would willingly return to campus at 1:30am on a Monday strictly for the purpose of running. But there is a lot more to it than just running. Equally and if not more important is the friendship and comradery that club running gives us. Thanks to these friendships I know many of us would do this all the time if we were given the chance. Running is very important to all of us. But, there is just something about the friends we have met through running which makes it truly special. I want to say thank you to the officers for all their hard work. I also want to thank my teammates and friends for such a fun weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that my emotions are sufficiently in ruin it is time for some meme reviews.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/4VIN396\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4VIN396\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lillian</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/83zZX3Y\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/83zZX3Y\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Max</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/060ZTv9\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/060ZTv9\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nate</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/84LSaEp\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/84LSaEp\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sohan</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/Kk2ZWf4\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Kk2ZWf4\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sohan</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/I9iRI3K\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/I9iRI3K\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Max</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/6hncPwG\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6hncPwG\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Stas</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/dmoA0ev\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dmoA0ev\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Konrad</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/Qj8d3br\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Qj8d3br\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gabe</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/DJ7bfqV\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DJ7bfqV\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nate</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'NIRCA Track and Field Nationals 2022 Day 2', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '541-revision-v1', '', '', '2022-04-12 19:57:22', '2022-04-12 23:57:22', '', 541, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=558', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman.

After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record!

After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800.

Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman.

After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record!

Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

Despite dealing with some illness Gabe Worthington finished with a time of 16:36. In no time Gabe will have his immune system under control and he will be back running times he knows he can. Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman.

Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800.

We boarded the bus on another chilly and rainy Michigan morning. All one square mile of Olivet proper passed us by as most of us pass through for probably the last time in our lives. Having arrived at the facility the first two athletes scheduled to compete were Ben Griffith in the men’s long jump and Sophia Grossman in the women’s high jump.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though their events were scheduled early, the absurdly long time the heats were taking meant they did not compete until later in the day.

Despite dealing with some illness Gabe Worthington finished with a time of 16:36. In no time Gabe will have his immune system under control and he will be back running times he knows he can. Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Andrew Scalese ran a time of 2:37. With no strava to stalk I don’t have much to say about his performance. Nate Lieske was the next finisher. Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

Finishing in a time of 10:37 Stas ran the 5th fastest steeple in club history, placed 7th, and scored 2 points for the team.

There are not many college students that would willingly return to campus at 1:30am on a Monday strictly for the purpose of running. But there is a lot more to it than just running. Equally and if not more important is the friendship and comradery that club running gives us. Thanks to these friendships I know many of us would do this all the time if we were given the chance. Running is very important to all of us. But, there is just something about the friends we have met through running which makes it truly special.

We boarded the bus on another chilly and rainy Michigan morning. All one square mile of Olivet proper passed us by as most of us pass through for probably the last time in our lives. Having arrived at the facility the first two athletes scheduled to compete were Ben Griffith in the men’s long jump and Sophia Grossman in the women’s high jump.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though their events were scheduled early, the absurdly long time the heats were taking meant they did not compete until later in the day.

Despite dealing with some illness Gabe Worthington finished with a time of 16:36. In no time Gabe will have his immune system under control and he will be back running times he knows he can. Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Eamon. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Andrew Scalese ran a time of 2:37. With no strava to stalk I don’t have much to say about his performance. Nate Lieske was the next finisher. Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

Finishing in a time of 10:37 Stas ran the 5th fastest steeple in club history, placed 7th, and scored 2 points for the team. This sunk Ohio State to the bottom of the steeple pool and put our sights on Pitt with just the men’s 4x400 to go.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 4x400 Relay</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had two teams in the men’s 4x400.

Cap ran a 57s and unofficial PR of one second. Jacob Bush also ran an unofficial PR of 63s. The Maryland “A” team ran the 5th fastest men’s outdoor 4x400 in club history! Max Worley, Konrad Shire, Dom Cardone, and Clay Buckman ran a time of 3:30.52 to place 5th and score a very important 4 points.

There are not many college students that would willingly return to campus at 1:30am on a Monday strictly for the purpose of running. But there is a lot more to it than just running. Equally and if not more important is the friendship and comradery that club running gives us. Thanks to these friendships I know many of us would do this all the time if we were given the chance. Running is very important to all of us. But, there is just something about the friends we have met through running which makes it truly special.

There are not many college students that would willingly return to campus at 1:30am on a Monday strictly for the purpose of running. But there is a lot more to it than just running. Equally and if not more important is the friendship and comradery that club running gives us. Thanks to these friendships I know many of us would do this all the time if we were given the chance. Running is very important to all of us. But, there is just something about the friends we have met through running which makes it truly special. I want to say thank you to the officers for all their hard work. I also want to thank my teammates and friends for such a fun weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that my emotions are sufficiently in ruin it is time for some meme reviews.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/4VIN396\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4VIN396\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By Lillian - There was a collective sigh of relief when we passed the border into Michigan.

We boarded the bus on another chilly and rainy Michigan morning. All one square mile of Olivet proper passed us by as most of us pass through for probably the last time in our lives. Having arrived at the facility the first two athletes scheduled to compete were Ben Griffith in the men’s long jump and Sophia Grossman in the women’s high jump.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though their events were scheduled early, the absurdly long time the heats were taking meant they did not compete until later in the day.

Despite dealing with some illness Gabe Worthington finished with a time of 16:36. In no time Gabe will have his immune system under control and he will be back running times he knows he can. Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Plante. In this first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800. Rachel enthusiastically ran a time of 3:07 which was faster than her goal of 3:10. Going into the race Diana’s goal was to run sub 3:30. Diana smashed this goal by running 2:41. This puts Diana 8th in club history for the women’s outdoor 800.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similar to the men’s 1500 yesterday the men’s 800 had seemingly endless heats. Andrew Scalese ran a time of 2:37. With no strava to stalk I don’t have much to say about his performance. Nate Lieske was the next finisher. Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and a leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants.

So I will start with the first event we had athletes in.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s 5000 (final 2 heats)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last 2 heats of the men’s 5000 produced some great times for our athletes. Despite dealing with some illness Gabe Worthington finished with a time of 16:36. In no time Gabe will have his immune system under control and he will be back running times he knows he can. Running his first of two events today Matt Stasiukevicius was next in the 5000. Running a time of 16:02 Stas was happy with this because his main focus of the day was the 3000 steeple. Our first PR of the day came courtesy Eamon “Plante Eamon” Plante. In his first sub 16 minute 5000 Eamon finished with a time of 15:53. Eamon tapered everyone’s expectations by saying he wasn’t going to finish his race. Despite a slight quad malfunction Eamon ran a great race. Our next PR and top 5000 finisher was Adam “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” Morad. With a time of 15:27 Adam placed 18th in the men’s 5000 as just a freshman. This gave Adam the 2nd fastest freshman outdoor 5000 time in club history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Men\'s Long Jump and Women\'s High Jump</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time between the men’s 5000 and the 800s Ben and Sophia finally had the chance to compete in their field events. Ben’s goal coming in was to break 15 feet. After warming up, cooling down, and warming up again Ben achieved his goal and jumped 4.71m which is 15.45 feet. After her strong performance in the women’s shot put yesterday Sophia looked to continue her success today. Unfortunately, the high jump and long jump were not close in proximity. So as I spectated Ben’s long jumps I did not see many of Sophia’s early attempts. However, as I walked toward the team area I saw one of Sophia’s attempts from afar. As she cleared the jump all her teammates watching jumped up and cheered. So I figured I should keep walking and see what happened. The commotion was caused by Sophia matching her PR of 1.60m. There are no outdoor women’s high jumps listed on the record list so either Sophia matched her own club record or set a new club record! Regardless, Sophia scored 10 points for the women’s team and was the 2022 NIRCA High Jump Champion. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women\'s 800</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up were Rachel George and Diana Liepinya in the women’s 800.

Andrew Scalese ran a time of 2:37. With no strava to stalk I don’t have much to say about his performance. Nate Lieske was the next finisher. Running a time of 2:27 Nate set a new 22 second PR in his second ever open 800. Zach “I’m Going To Ignore The Seniors In The Dining Hall” Kiedrowski described his 2:26 as, “Ouch.” Frankie Andrews ran a solid time of 2:24. Similar to your Mom, Frankie finished just after Jacob Bush. JB ran a solid time of 2:23. However, on strava JB said there were no excuses for such a bad race. After not a lot of training Matt Sebsibe was happy to run a time of 2:17. Cap LaBuff had another strong race finishing his 800 in 2:12. After a massive PR in the 5000 yesterday Sam Fields looked to continue his dominance into today’s 800. Despite running a faster time trial and leg of the 4x800 before this was Sam’s first time running sub 2:10. With a time of 2:09 Sam was another PR on the day. While having an up and down season thanks to some weird health issues Konrad Shire looked to finally turn the corner in his open 800. I know running a 2:08 was not what Konrad was looking for, but everyone knows if he just keeps his head up and keeps working he will get to where he wants. For the next two 800 runners I have to talk about them together.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/oXxEbXn\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"imgur\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur wp-block-embed-imgur\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oXxEbXn\n</div><figcaption>Brian Lau and Chris Scalzi embrace after the 800.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian Lau and Chris Scalzi worked together in their heat of the 800.

Middle Distance runner from Howard County, Maryland. Brian is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Math. Other notable accomplishments include being a Teaching Assistant for CMSC132 at UMD, creating Joke.Py, and maintaining a 4.0 GPA. This is the story of Brian Lau vs the 2 minute barrier of the 800 meter run.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The origins</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian’s 800 meter running journey began in the Spring of 2018, at Winters Mill High School, where he ran 2:23 for 3rd place at a dual meet. Throughout his freshman year, he would continue to cut this time down from 2:17 to 2:12 to 2:11. Little is known about the details of this inaugural season for Brian, but you could say it was the start of something great.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian returned to the 800 meter racing scene in Winter of 2018 where he ran indoor track for the first time. While he had a bit of a shaky start to the season, he lowered his PR to 2:10.53 at Indoor Track Regionals. Later in the Spring of 2019, Brian lowered his PR further in a blazing 2:03 800 at the DMV Meet of the Elite in June of 2019.&nbsp; From this performance, Brian claims he was destined to run Division 1 in the NCAA racing scene.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next Indoor Track Season, he would run around 2:08 to PR indoors. Outdoor season was going to be his big breakthrough, where he would soon be recruited by college coaches across the country. However, in March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic stole away the most crucial season for Brian’s college recruitment journey and in turn his D1 career.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Throughout the Summer of 2020, Brian did not see much improvement in his era of unattached racing with the Bullseye Running Club. As the pandemic began to settle down, Brian returned to the MPSSAA racing scene in their abbreviated track season, where he ran 2:03.83 at a random dual meet. Brian was not some washed up runner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite these great developments, Brian was snubbed by many colleges he was interested in both academically and as a potential NCAA runner. He was rejected&nbsp; by Cornell, Rice, Stanford, Hopkins, and Carnegie Mellon to name a few. With these prospects looking dim, Brian would enroll at the University of Maryland to continue his studies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Fall 2021</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the Fall of his freshman year at UMD, he joined the UMD Club Running Team to avoid getting fat and to maybe make some friends along the way. Brian absolutely hates cross country but decided to do some races because it would be silly and goofy.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, at the NIRCA Mid-Atlantic Regionals race, there was a distinct moment around the 3.8 mile mark, where him, Jacob Bush, and Nick Gonzàlez were all in immense pain, not talking, and hurting so much that Brian vowed to never run a cross country race again*. He has not raced a cross country race since.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*except NIRCA cross country nationals that year because it was a fun road trip where he got to hang out with Frankie Andrews.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Spring 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Happy Valley Invitational 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Insert pic</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian Lau toed the line for the 800m of an indoor track for the first time since 2019. Seeded into section 2 out of 3, Brian was seeded in the middle of the pack, but would win the heat in 2:08. He even scored a singular point for the team scoring. While slower than his PR, this was when Brian knew he was still destined for greatness and not washed up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yet.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Maryland Invite</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>UMD’s D1 Outdoor Track team was set to host the Maryland Invite as an early season opener for its athletes. A notoriously selective meet with competitive standards, Brian was undeterred and requested entry with his 54 second 400. Brian was not accepted into the meet. Former President Matthew Stasikeuvecuius allegedly voiced his support for Brian’s entry into the meet but I could not find any documentation of this occurring. Brian settled for volunteering at the meet while he watched his high school friend and current club teammate, Jake Muma run a 2:02 800m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NIRCA Nationals 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian joined the club on their trek to Olivet, Michigan. Aboard the 8,000 dollar charter bus, Brian made good use of the group’s forced proximity to one another to pull off possibly the greatest April Fool’s prank in Club history. His victim? Former Vice President Sohan Ganatra. You just had to be there to watch him open the email from <a href=\"mailto:Weddy.umd.edu@gmail.com\">Weddy.umd.edu@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides that, there was a national intercollegiate track championship to be run.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian toed the line alongside Chris Scalzi, a fellow mid distance training partner of Brian. He woke up poorly rested and somewhat sore that day, probably because he ran a 1500 the day before. He went out in 60 in second place, but in the last 200m he probably got passed by half the field, including Chris. He would finish in 2:06, 2 seconds behind Chris. They had an emotional embrace immediately afterward. Brian’s eyes were now set on the third annual Terrapin Invitational.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Terrapin Invite</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two weeks later, it was a bright sunny day for the Terrapin Invite. The stacked mid distance squad of the club had their eyes set on the men’s 4x800m club record. Initially, Brian wasn’t even a part of it, but injury struck Jake Muma and Brian had to step up and fill in. Despite a poor week of training and a less than stellar pre meet, Brian took the lead leg on the race and set the team up for success with a 2:05 split. Some might say he even carried the club to a new club record in 8:03.20.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hours later, Brian would toe the line for the open 800. It was terrible. He opened in 62 and began coughing and dry heaving. It didn’t help that his pollen allergies had been flaring up. This was the start of Brian’s asthma and pollen allergies arc. 600 meters in he blew a hole in one of his spikes. Contemplating dropping out, he settled for a pitiful closing 200 and ended up in 7th place with a 2:10. Truly the most embarrassing moment of his career. Brian had not run a race over 2:09 in at least a few years. He contemplated never stepping foot on a track again.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An hour later, he bounced back with a 14:51 3000 meter steeplechase, holding hands with Gabe Worthington and Matt Sebsibe through the finish line.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Paul Kaiser Classic 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A week later, Brian returned to the racing scene, this time up in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. Sore, decked out in ripped spikes, and low expectations, Brian toed the line once more. In a NCAA field, he went out in 60, but had a mediocre closing to finish in 2:05. He trailed behind Chris Scalzi to witness him break 2:00 for the first time to qualify for the Kehoe Twilight Invite. Despite a mediocre day, Brian had a great time going to Mission Barbecue with John and Dominick, which he describes as “delicious, but expensive.” Brian did not bother trying to enter the highly selective Kehoe Invite. His season was over.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Baltimore Marathon</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Summer after his freshman year at Maryland, Brian decided to dabble in some longer distances, “for the vibes.”&nbsp; He ran some high mileage for a few months, got COVID-19 at one point, created Joke.Py, and then he paid a couple hundred dollars to go run a marathon around Baltimore. Brian was on pace for a sub&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3 hour performance until about the last 10k. In his words, “It sucked. It hurt.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Spring 2023</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Towson Spring Open</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After disappearing from the Club’s racing scene for several months, Brian returned to the world of mid distance running alongside Jake Muma at the Towson Spring Open. Despite these months of absence, Brian continued his trend of always having some strange unspecified illness plaguing his performance, even contemplating scratching before he even rolled out of bed that day. Nonetheless, he made it to the starting line. He opened in 59.99, ahead of Jake and closed in 1:03 for a tiny PR of 2:03.14. This was the first time Brian had ever beaten Jake in a race and all the world (just Brian) took notice. He was once again fueled to go after the sub 2:00 800 this season.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On another note, Brian once again pulled off another one of his iconic fake email April Fool’s Pranks on the Club’s President, Sohan, who once again fell for it. It pranked Sohan so hard that he got food poisoning the next day and did not make it to the meet.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NIRCA Track Nationals 2023</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian Lau chose not to attend NIRCA Nationals in 2023. He signed up until he realized that he had no desire to return to Olivet, Michigan even though he was promised to be put in a car with Frankie Andrews. This was very inconvenient for the Vice President who was planning this trip and it was not appreciated.

Middle Distance runner from Howard County, Maryland. Brian is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Math. Other notable accomplishments include being a Teaching Assistant for CMSC132 at UMD, creating Joke.Py, and maintaining a 4.0 GPA. This is the story of Brian Lau vs the 2 minute barrier of the 800 meter run.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The origins</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian’s 800 meter running journey began in the Spring of 2018, at Winters Mill High School, where he ran 2:23 for 3rd place at a dual meet. Throughout his freshman year, he would continue to cut this time down from 2:17 to 2:12 to 2:11. Little is known about the details of this inaugural season for Brian, but you could say it was the start of something great.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian returned to the 800 meter racing scene in Winter of 2018 where he ran indoor track for the first time. While he had a bit of a shaky start to the season, he lowered his PR to 2:10.53 at Indoor Track Regionals. Later in the Spring of 2019, Brian lowered his PR further in a blazing 2:03 800 at the DMV Meet of the Elite in June of 2019.&nbsp; From this performance, Brian claims he was destined to run Division 1 in the NCAA racing scene.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next Indoor Track Season, he would run around 2:08 to PR indoors. Outdoor season was going to be his big breakthrough, where he would soon be recruited by college coaches across the country. However, in March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic stole away the most crucial season for Brian’s college recruitment journey and in turn his D1 career.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Throughout the Summer of 2020, Brian did not see much improvement in his era of unattached racing with the Bullseye Running Club. As the pandemic began to settle down, Brian returned to the MPSSAA racing scene in their abbreviated track season, where he ran 2:03.83 at a random dual meet. Brian was not some washed up runner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite these great developments, Brian was snubbed by many colleges he was interested in both academically and as a potential NCAA runner. He was rejected&nbsp; by Cornell, Rice, Stanford, Hopkins, and Carnegie Mellon to name a few. With these prospects looking dim, Brian would enroll at the University of Maryland to continue his studies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Fall 2021</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the Fall of his freshman year at UMD, he joined the UMD Club Running Team to avoid getting fat and to maybe make some friends along the way. Brian absolutely hates cross country but decided to do some races because it would be silly and goofy.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, at the NIRCA Mid-Atlantic Regionals race, there was a distinct moment around the 3.8 mile mark, where him, Jacob Bush, and Nick Gonzàlez were all in immense pain, not talking, and hurting so much that Brian vowed to never run a cross country race again*. He has not raced a cross country race since.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*except NIRCA cross country nationals that year because it was a fun road trip where he got to hang out with Frankie Andrews.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Spring 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Happy Valley Invitational 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Insert pic</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian Lau toed the line for the 800m of an indoor track for the first time since 2019.

A notoriously selective meet with competitive standards, Brian was undeterred and requested entry with his 54 second 400. Brian was not accepted into the meet. Former President Matthew Stasikeuvecuius allegedly voiced his support for Brian’s entry into the meet but I could not find any documentation of this occurring. Brian settled for volunteering at the meet while he watched his high school friend and current club teammate, Jake Muma run a 2:02 800m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NIRCA Nationals 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian joined the club on their trek to Olivet, Michigan. Aboard the 8,000 dollar charter bus, Brian made good use of the group’s forced proximity to one another to pull off possibly the greatest April Fool’s prank in Club history. His victim? Former Vice President Sohan Ganatra. You just had to be there to watch him open the email from <a href=\"mailto:Weddy.umd.edu@gmail.com\">Weddy.umd.edu@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides that, there was a national intercollegiate track championship to be run.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brian toed the line alongside Chris Scalzi, a fellow mid distance training partner of Brian. He woke up poorly rested and somewhat sore that day, probably because he ran a 1500 the day before. He went out in 60 in second place, but in the last 200m he probably got passed by half the field, including Chris. He would finish in 2:06, 2 seconds behind Chris. They had an emotional embrace immediately afterward. Brian’s eyes were now set on the third annual Terrapin Invitational.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Terrapin Invite</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two weeks later, it was a bright sunny day for the Terrapin Invite. The stacked mid distance squad of the club had their eyes set on the men’s 4x800m club record. Initially, Brian wasn’t even a part of it, but injury struck Jake Muma and Brian had to step up and fill in. Despite a poor week of training and a less than stellar pre meet, Brian took the lead leg on the race and set the team up for success with a 2:05 split. Some might say he even carried the club to a new club record in 8:03.20.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hours later, Brian would toe the line for the open 800. It was terrible. He opened in 62 and began coughing and dry heaving. It didn’t help that his pollen allergies had been flaring up. This was the start of Brian’s asthma and pollen allergies arc. 600 meters in he blew a hole in one of his spikes. Contemplating dropping out, he settled for a pitiful closing 200 and ended up in 7th place with a 2:10. Truly the most embarrassing moment of his career. Brian had not run a race over 2:09 in at least a few years. He contemplated never stepping foot on a track again.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An hour later, he bounced back with a 14:51 3000 meter steeplechase, holding hands with Gabe Worthington and Matt Sebsibe through the finish line.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Paul Kaiser Classic 2022</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A week later, Brian returned to the racing scene, this time up in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. Sore, decked out in ripped spikes, and low expectations, Brian toed the line once more. In a NCAA field, he went out in 60, but had a mediocre closing to finish in 2:05. He trailed behind Chris Scalzi to witness him break 2:00 for the first time to qualify for the Kehoe Twilight Invite. Despite a mediocre day, Brian had a great time going to Mission Barbecue with John and Dominick, which he describes as “delicious, but expensive.” Brian did not bother trying to enter the highly selective Kehoe Invite.

Brian was on pace for a sub&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3 hour performance until about the last 10k. In his words, “It sucked.

Despite these months of absence, Brian continued his trend of always having some strange unspecified illness plaguing his performance, even contemplating scratching before he even rolled out of bed that day. Nonetheless, he made it to the starting line. He opened in 59.99, ahead of Jake and closed in 1:03 for a tiny PR of 2:03.14. This was the first time Brian had ever beaten Jake in a race and all the world (just Brian) took notice. He was once again fueled to go after the sub 2:00 800 this season.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On another note, Brian once again pulled off another one of his iconic fake email April Fool’s Pranks on the Club’s President, Sohan, who once again fell for it.

Sam is a junior physics major and history minor at the University of Maryland, and has been a member of UMD Club Running since his first semester on campus, Fall 2021. Sam’s passion for physics began as a young lad, having a brilliant physics teacher at Towson high school. Since then, in his first three years of studying at UMD, he’s gained a fascination specifically for high energy physics, a subject he hopes to learn more about in the remaining years of his collegiate learning. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Early Years</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While Sam is very apparently an academic weapon, his arsenal expands beyond just this and dabbles in the athletic realm as well. Since before Sam was even a thought in his parents’ minds, the universe knew that running would be in his DNA. Sam’s dad was a runner when he was in high school, so it seemed like destiny that Sam would follow in his footsteps and become a runner himself. Sam felt this calling before his age even hit double digits, beginning his racing career in elementary school, signing up for the Charm City cross country races. Despite not training for these races, Sam established himself as a genetic beast in 5th grade, placing first in the elementary school division of the Towson Turkey Trot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Living off the high of this win at the end of his elementary school career, Sam knew he would need to take it up a notch to have similar success in middle school. Immediately upon starting middle school, Sam decided to join his middle school’s cross country and track team. This involved a rigorous practice schedule of running 4 times a week. Training consistently during his middle school years, his hard work culminated in a breathtakingly impressive season his 8th grade year, winning multiple Baltimore County races during the cross country season.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>High School Turmoil</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After this 8th grade year, Sam was yet again forced to move up to his next level of schooling. In his previous years of running, Sam was racing literal children. In high school, he would continue to race children, but children who were fully grown… and very fast. It was a big jump up from middle and elementary school. In his first year at Towson high school, Sam battled to get into the top 7 runners on his team during cross country. It was tough, but Sam being someone who is often described as “built different” managed to secure a varsity spot on the team by the end of his first season. Sam would continue to thrive and conquer the poor runners who unfortunately were placed in the same heats as him during his freshman track season as well. Everything seemed like it was going smoothly, and it was for a while. However, it was only a matter of time until the <em>Baltimore Armory Incident</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The year is 2019. It’s a cold February night, and Sam Fields is racing a 3200m race at the Baltimore Armory. At this point in time, Sam had no idea that what was about to happen was going to change the trajectory of his running career forever. Sam was running the first few laps, feeling good, chilling. Some would even say it was a good race. Then… during the second half of the race, Sam suddenly puked on the track and his race came to an end. The fans and crowd were shocked as Sam went off the track. Who knew what would come next for him?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After this incident, Sam continued running, but he couldn’t shake the memory of what happened at the Baltimore Armory. He went into a slump that would last him until the end of high school. After two years of running times not up to his standards, Sam was burnt out by the time he graduated. The two years before Sam began college were very grim in terms of his running career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>UMD Club Running - The Revival</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a summer off from running, Sam was hoping to restart fresh and make a return to running upon coming on campus at the University of Maryland in Fall 2021. Sam decided to join UMD Club Running as a way to get back into running while also hoping to make new friends and form a new community during this new stage of his life. Sam quickly formed some close friends in the club, and was more motivated than ever to get back into running.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All fall semester in 2021 Sam grinded to get back into shape. He started racing cross country again during this time. He was having lots of fun but early on into the semester he still didn’t feel fully back in shape since his pre-incident self. However, towards the end of the semester Sam decided to embark on a trip to Shelbyville Indiana with his newfound club running community to race NIRCA cross country nationals. This was the start of Sam’s true return, and the first step to finally getting him out of his slump that at this point was long overstaying its welcome. Sam put down an impressive time of 28:23 in his 8k, shattering all of his expectations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>A True Long Distance Runner - Struggle and Perseverance</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coming off of his impressive performance at nationals, Sam started training harder than ever to try to get even faster. Once the Spring semester began, Sam started having more fun with the sport than he ever had. He started running farther and farther than ever before, even reaching runs of 20 miles or longer. His strava followers looked forward to his long runs every week, and were left in awe at his posts every single time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Knowing his base fitness was the strongest its ever been, Sam decided to try running a marathon. He didn’t sign up for a race. All Sam needed was a Saturday morning and an aid bike, courtesy of Zach Kiedrowski.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a rainy Saturday in May 2022. It was the day Sam was going to run a marathon. Zach asked Sam several times if he wanted to reschedule for a day with better weather. Sam committed to running and decided he would do it rain or shine. Sam started running and was feeling relatively good through 20 miles and was well on pace to run a sub 3 hour time. Little did he know what was going to happen only a few miles later. Once Sam hit the 23.5 mile mark, his body gave out. He couldn’t keep going. His dreams of running a marathon that day were done. He had to get picked up and return to his dorm.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A week after the attempted marathon incident, Sam couldn’t help but still feel angry. “How could I have gone out so fast? I should’ve known better.” He wanted to do better. He didn’t want to be known as the person who <em>attempted </em>a marathon. He wanted to get the job done. Not even a week after the failed marathon attempt, Sam already made up his mind that he was going to run the Baltimore Marathon in October 2022. This was his only chance at redemption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a summer filled with high mileage, long runs, fast workouts, and most of all mental strength, Sam felt ready for the Baltimore Marathon. He had two goals for the race: 1. Finish 2. Finish with a Boston Qualifying time of under 3 hours. Sam was more confident than ever that he could achieve these goals. His training had gone super well, and this time he wasn’t alone. He was running the marathon along with three of his best friends and roommates.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the day of the race Sam proved that his confidence was justified. He had a hard fought race. He even yakked several times during the second half of the race, but he still finished in a Boston qualifying time of 2:52:54. Having high expectations for himself, Sam still felt like he could’ve done a bit better, but was super proud of the race, especially knowing he didn’t eat at all the whole 2 hours and 52 minutes. He knew he redeemed himself, and he was proud of himself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Reflection and the Present Day</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sam has continued running to the present day, with lots of impressive performances since his marathon. He has put up an impressive 5k pr of 15:41, and has run cross country 8k races in under 27 minutes. Sam shows no signs of slowing down, running up to 80 miles per week and constantly improving his times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Outside of running, Sam can be seen listening to music, with some of his favorite artists being Jimmy Hendrix and JPEGmafia. He is also an avid gamer, playing overwatch, red dead redemption, and using the two most disgusting combinations in the history of Mario Kart Wii (Funky Kong Flamerunner and Daisy Mach Bike).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sam looks back on his running journey and is grateful. The hardships, despite feeling hopeless at times, made him so much stronger. The friendships he made are everlasting and irreplaceable. Knowing this, how could he trade his experience for anything?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Sam Fields Spotlight', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'sam-fields-spotlight', '', '', '2023-10-18 14:14:44', '2023-10-18 18:14:44', '', 0, 'http://umdclubrunning.com/blog/?p=633', 0, 'post', '', 1),

The lead pack booked it for Stamp by cutting through the Cambridge Community area and up to Stamp. Leading the pack to the Maryland Dairy were Eamon Plante, Jacob Bush, and Ian Siegler, and Andrew Cullen (for about 30 seconds). Onlookers looked on in horror as the line for the Maryland Dairy began to form to unprecedented lengths seen outside of Student tour groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I finally made it to Maryland Dairy, Jacob and Eamon were already inhaling their ice creams. I asked Jacob for a comment about how he felt at the current time and he replied, “feeling fire.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite not being in the front pack of the line, Zach shoveled that Terpresso down and was the first competitor to leave for Cold Stone. Jacob quickly finished his strawberry ice cream to lead the chase after Zach. Cap was the next competitor to leave Maryland Dairy, followed by Eamon, then Ian and Ben.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Maryland Dairy to Cold Stone</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jacob led the chase pack after Zach en route to Cold Stone, followed by Cap, Eamon, Ian, and Ben. While Zach definitely ate faster, Jacob had the superior footspeed, passing him on the stretch across Mckeldin Mall to Cold Stone.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;Zach however managed to outkick Jacob to Cold Stone and got served first. Cold Stone is infamous for being rather slow and today was no exception. This was a key moment that secured Zach’s position in first. He demolished his ice cream before Jacob’s order even finished ringing up and booked it up Route 1 to Rita’s.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Cold Stone to Rita’s&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Zach was the first to arrive at Rita’s and ordered a custard swirl, which in retrospect he regrets and would have gone with just chocolate.

Ian demolished his Rita’s for an impressive 4th place.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next two finishers were Ben and Cap for 5th and 6th. Cap claimed that non-competitor Sam Fields cost him time at the Rita’s by ordering in front of him and thus slowing him down.

The deceptively large “small” custard portion was demoralizing for many. Sohan struggled for a while with his custard, “Nate sucks. I regret ever meeting Nate.” Needless to say Sohan definitely took a while at the Rita’s stop. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dominick and Kalabe were trailing close behind Sohan and Andrew en route to Rita’s.

Sam felt this calling before his age even hit double digits, beginning his racing career in elementary school, signing up for the Charm City cross country races.

It was tough, but Sam being someone who is often described as “built different” managed to secure a varsity spot on the team by the end of his first season.

Besides very slight scratches given to Evan\'s car in Lot 16 by an unknown inadequate parker, his car is truly a work of art and gives all of the other drivers something to strive for. The drive started off a little rough with some rain and annoying traffic but once Evan announced that anyone was free to queue songs on his phone we really got into the best part of the drive. We listened to the entirety of Guts by Olivia Rodrigo which I was very happy about due to the fact that previously Evan was playing some very questionable hip hop \"music\" that was really just people talking over other songs (no thank you!). After we listened to Guts the Taylor Swift sing along began and I was having a blast. I would have to say that the peak enjoyment for me was when we all sang along to a remixed version of You Belong With Me by Taylor Swift that Evan made. The remix was electric and definitely made me despise Evan\'s music taste slightly less.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In terms of his actual driving ability Evan showed a great deal of skill and control while he operated his motor vehicle. Although he wasn\'t always the fastest or most aggressive driver he preformed very well and was able to navigate the traffic with expertise. That being said during the way home from the meet Evan did in fact almost rear end someone because we suddenly cam across standstill traffic, but I\'ll forgive him for that because he said \"My bad guys\" after.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Evan made the executive decision that we would stop at Sheetz for dinner on the way to the hotel which would have been great if we didn\'t also eat lunch at Sheetz the very next day. The Sheetz that we went to wasn\'t that great and included no indoor seating so Evan sacrificed a relaxing meal time by pounding out his food so that we could return to the road and everyone else could eat in the car. Due to the efficiency of our lunch stop we arrived at the infamous Allentown Super 8 with no other club runners in sight. At first we thought that this meant that we had gotten there first and thus that Evan was the best driver out of all those that went to Regionals, but it turns out that another car had actually gotten to the Super 8 first and then left to go eat dinner at Chipotle. I think that this possible second place arrival makes me indecisive on wether or not I should crown Evan as the best driver in the club, so I am curious to hear your thoughts in the comments.
